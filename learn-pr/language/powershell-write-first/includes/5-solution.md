The following code is one possible solution to the challenge in the preceding unit.

```powershell
$date = Read-Host "What is today's date"
$name = Read-Host "Please enter your name"
Write-Output "Today's date is $date."
Write-Output "Today is the day $name began a PowerShell programming journey."
```

This code is only *one possible solution*. Your code could look different. However you write the code, you should use `Read-Host` and `Write-Output` to produce the desired output.

```output
Today's date is 10/05/2023.
Today is the day Chase began a PowerShell programming journey.
```

If you succeeded, congratulations! Continue to the knowledge check in the next unit.

### Step 1: Close any open files in the Cloud Shell code editor

To close any open files in the Azure Cloud Shell code editor, use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd> in Windows (or <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd> on macOS).

### Step 2: Create a new file and write your code

Create a new file named `GettingStarted.ps1`, and use the Cloud Shell code editor to open it.

### Step 3: Write code in the Cloud Shell code editor that displays two messages

Use the techniques that you learned in the last exercise, to print one message and then collect user input for reuse in a second message. Earlier, you displayed a message in just one line of code. You then requested input from a user and then reused that value to print a custom message. Use both techniques for this challenge.

No matter how you do it, your code should produce something like the following output. In this example, replace the placeholder text `<current date>` and `<your name>` with values that you choose.

```output
Today's date is <current date>.
Today is the day <your name> began a PowerShell programming journey.
```

### Step 4: Run the code

Close the code editor, and then run the script in the Cloud Shell terminal.

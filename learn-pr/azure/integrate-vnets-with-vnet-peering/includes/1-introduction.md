Imagine you're the solution architect for an engineering company that has been migrating services into Azure. The company deployed services into separate virtual networks, but has yet to configure private connectivity between them.

Several business units identified services in these virtual networks that need to communicate with each other. You need to enable this connectivity, but you don't want to expose these services to the internet. You also want to keep the integration as simple as possible.

In this module, you learn about virtual network connection options and why virtual network peering is suited for this scenario. You create three virtual networks and configure virtual network peering between them. You then test your configuration to make sure it meets your connectivity goals.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Identify use cases for virtual network peering.
- Identify the features and limitations of virtual network peering.
- Configure peering connections between virtual networks.

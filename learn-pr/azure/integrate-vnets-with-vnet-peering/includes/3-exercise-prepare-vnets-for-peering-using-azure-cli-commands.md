Let's say your company is now ready to implement virtual network peering. You want to connect systems that are deployed in different virtual networks. To test this plan, you start by creating virtual networks to support the services your company is already running in Azure. You need three virtual networks:

- The **Sales** virtual network is deployed in **North Europe**. Sales systems use this virtual network to process the data added after a customer is engaged. The Sales team wants access to Marketing data.
- The **Marketing** virtual network is deployed in **North Europe**. Marketing systems use this virtual network. Members of the Marketing team regularly chat with the Sales team. To share their data with the Sales team, they must download it because the Sales and Marketing systems aren't connected.
- The **Research** virtual network is deployed in **West Europe**. Research systems use this virtual network. Members of the Research team have a logical working relationship with Marketing, but they don't want the Sales team to have direct access to their data.

You're going to create the following resources:

| Virtual network | Region | Virtual network address space | Subnet | Subnet address space |
| ---- | ------ | ------------------ | ------ | -------------------- |
| SalesVNet | North Europe | 10.1.0.0/16 | Apps | 10.1.1.0/24 |
| MarketingVNet | North Europe | 10.2.0.0/16 | Apps | 10.2.1.0/24 |
| ResearchVNet | West Europe | 10.3.0.0/16 | Data | 10.3.1.0/24 |

## Create the virtual networks

1. In Cloud Shell, run the following command to create the virtual network and subnet for the **Sales** systems:

    ```azurecli
    az network vnet create \
        --resource-group "myResourceGroupName" \
        --name SalesVNet \
        --address-prefixes 10.1.0.0/16 \
        --subnet-name Apps \
        --subnet-prefixes 10.1.1.0/24 \
        --location northeurope
    ```

1. Run the following command to create the virtual network and subnet for the **Marketing** systems:

    ```azurecli
    az network vnet create \
        --resource-group "myResourceGroupName" \
        --name MarketingVNet \
        --address-prefixes 10.2.0.0/16 \
        --subnet-name Apps \
        --subnet-prefixes 10.2.1.0/24 \
        --location northeurope
    ```

1. Run the following command to create the virtual network and subnet for the **Research** systems:

    ```azurecli
    az network vnet create \
        --resource-group "myResourceGroupName" \
        --name ResearchVNet \
        --address-prefixes 10.3.0.0/16 \
        --subnet-name Data \
        --subnet-prefixes 10.3.1.0/24 \
        --location westeurope
    ```

## Confirm the virtual network configuration

Let's take a quick look at what you created.

1. View the virtual networks you've created by running the following command in Cloud Shell:

    ```azurecli
    az network vnet list --query "[?contains(provisioningState, 'Succeeded')]" --output table
    ```

1. Your output should look like this example:

    ```output
    Location     Name           EnableDdosProtection    ProvisioningState    ResourceGuid                          ResourceGroup
    -----------  -------------  ----------------------  -------------------  ------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------
    westeurope   ResearchVNet   False                   Succeeded            9fe09fe0-d6cd-4043-aba8-b5e850a91251  learn-cb081b92-bc67-49cf-a965-1aeb40a2e25c
    northeurope  SalesVNet      False                   Succeeded            8f030706-cce4-4a7b-8da2-a9f738887ffd  learn-cb081b92-bc67-49cf-a965-1aeb40a2e25c
    northeurope  MarketingVNet  False                   Succeeded            ffbf8430-b0eb-4c3d-aa94-3b3156b90bed  learn-cb081b92-bc67-49cf-a965-1aeb40a2e25c
    ```

## Create virtual machines in each virtual network

Now, you deploy some Ubuntu virtual machines (VMs) in each of the virtual networks. These VMs simulate the services in each virtual network. In the final unit of this module, you use these VMs to test connectivity between the virtual networks.

1. In Cloud Shell, run the following command, replacing `<password>` with a password that meets the [requirements for Linux VMs](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/faq?azure-portal=true#what-are-the-password-requirements-when-creating-a-vm), to create an Ubuntu virtual machine (VM) in the **Apps** subnet of **SalesVNet**. Note this password for later use.

    ```azurecli
    az vm create \
        --resource-group "myResourceGroupName" \
        --no-wait \
        --name SalesVM \
        --location northeurope \
        --vnet-name SalesVNet \
        --subnet Apps \
        --image Ubuntu2204 \
        --admin-username azureuser \
        --admin-password <password>
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > The `--no-wait` parameter in this command lets you continue working in Cloud Shell while the VM is building.

1. Run the following command, replacing `<password>` with a password that meets the [requirements for Linux VMs](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/faq?azure-portal=true#what-are-the-password-requirements-when-creating-a-vm), to create another Ubuntu VM in the **Apps** subnet of **MarketingVNet**. Note this password for later use. The VM might take a minute or two to be created.

    ```azurecli
    az vm create \
        --resource-group "myResourceGroupName" \
        --no-wait \
        --name MarketingVM \
        --location northeurope \
        --vnet-name MarketingVNet \
        --subnet Apps \
        --image Ubuntu2204 \
        --admin-username azureuser \
        --admin-password <password>
    ```

1. Run the following command, replacing `<password>` with a password that meets the [requirements for Linux VMs](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/faq?azure-portal=true#what-are-the-password-requirements-when-creating-a-vm), to create an Ubuntu VM in the **Data** subnet of **ResearchVNet**. Note this password for later use.

    ```azurecli
    az vm create \
        --resource-group "myResourceGroupName" \
        --no-wait \
        --name ResearchVM \
        --location westeurope \
        --vnet-name ResearchVNet \
        --subnet Data \
        --image Ubuntu2204 \
        --admin-username azureuser \
        --admin-password <password>
    ```

    The VMs might take several minutes to reach a running state.

1. To confirm that the VMs are running, run the following command. The Linux `watch` command is configured to refresh every five seconds.

    ```bash
    watch -d -n 5 "az vm list \
        --resource-group "myResourceGroupName" \
        --show-details \
        --query '[*].{Name:name, ProvisioningState:provisioningState, PowerState:powerState}' \
        --output table"
    ```

    A **ProvisioningState** of **Succeeded** and a **PowerState** of **VM running** indicates a successful deployment for the VM.

1. When your VMs are running, you're ready to move on. Press `Ctrl-c` to stop the command and continue on with the exercise.

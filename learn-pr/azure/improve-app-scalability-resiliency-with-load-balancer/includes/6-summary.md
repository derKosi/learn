In this module, you learned about Azure Load Balancer and how you can use Load Balancer to minimize the effect of failures and increase resilience and stability. You used this knowledge to create a resilient healthcare portal that can adapt to meet the application requirements of session affinity. You learned how to group virtual machines behind a load balancer to increase availability. By implementing the load balancer in the healthcare portal scenario, you learned about the differences between an internal and an external load balancer. You also discovered how you can configure a load balancer to provide availability across datacenters by using availability zones.

Azure Static Web Apps publishes websites to a production environment by building apps from a GitHub repository. In this exercise, you'll build a web application using your preferred front-end framework from a GitHub repository.

## Create a repository

This module makes it easy for you to create a new repository by using a GitHub template repository. A series of templates is available where each contains a starter app built with a different front-end framework.

1. Navigate to the [create from template page](https://github.com/login?return_to=/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-staticwebapp/generate?azure-portal=true) for the template repository. If you get a *404: Page Not Found* error, sign in to GitHub and try again.

1. Choose one of your GitHub accounts in the **Owner** drop-down.

1. Name your repository **my-static-web-app**.

1. Select the **Create repository** button.

## Run your app

You just created a GitHub repository named **my-static-web-app** in your GitHub account. Next, you'll clone the repo and run the code locally on your computer.

1. Open a terminal on your computer.

1. Start by cloning the GitHub repository to the desired directory on your computer.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/my-static-web-app
   ```

1. Go to the folder for your source code.

   ```bash
   cd my-static-web-app
   ```

1. Next, go to the folder of your preferred front-end framework, as follows.

   ::: zone pivot="angular"

   ```bash
   cd angular-app
   ```

   ::: zone-end

   ::: zone pivot="react"

   ```bash
   cd react-app
   ```

   ::: zone-end

   ::: zone pivot="svelte"

   ```bash
   cd svelte-app
   ```

   ::: zone-end

   ::: zone pivot="vue"

   ```bash
   cd vue-app
   ```

   ::: zone-end

1. Now, install the application dependencies.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you get a *Cannot find PATH* error, make sure you've installed Node.js from https://nodejs.org. You might need to do a **Custom setup** that includes installing the **Add to PATH** option.

1. Finally, run the front-end client application.

   ::: zone pivot="angular"

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   ::: zone-end

   ::: zone pivot="react"

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   ::: zone-end

   ::: zone pivot="svelte"

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   ::: zone-end

   ::: zone pivot="vue"

   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```

   ::: zone-end

## Browse to your app

It's time to see your application running locally. Each front-end application runs on a different port.

Select the link to browse to your application.

::: zone pivot="angular"

Browse to `http://localhost:4200`.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="react"

Browse to `http://localhost:3000`.

:::image type="content" source="../media/my-shopping-list-app-react.png" alt-text="Screenshot of browsing to your React web app.":::

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="svelte"

Browse to `http://localhost:5000`.

:::image type="content" source="../media/my-shopping-list-app-svelte.png" alt-text="Screenshot of browsing to your Svelte web app.":::

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="vue"

Browse to `http://localhost:8080`.

:::image type="content" source="../media/my-shopping-list-app-vue.png" alt-text="Screenshot of browsing to your Vue web app.":::

::: zone-end

> [!NOTE]
> In this module's exercises, you'll deploy an app without an API. See the *Next steps* section at the end of this module for information about the next module, where you'll deploy an API alongside your app.

Now, stop your running app by pressing <kbd>Ctrl-C</kbd> in the terminal.

## Next steps

You've built your application, and now it's running locally in your browser.

Next, you'll publish your application to Azure Static Web Apps.

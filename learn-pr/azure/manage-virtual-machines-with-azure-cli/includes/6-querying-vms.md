Now that we've created a virtual machine, we can get information about it through other commands.

Let's start by running `vm list`.

```azurecli
az vm list
```

This command will return _all_ virtual machines defined in this subscription. You can filter the output to a specific resource group through the `--resource-group` parameter.

## Output types

Notice that the default response type for all the commands we've done so far is JSON. This is great for scripting, but most people find it harder to read. You can change the output style for any response through the `--output` flag. For example, run the following command in Azure Cloud Shell to see the different output style.

```azurecli
az vm list --output table
```

Along with `table`, you can specify `json` (the default), `jsonc` (colorized JSON), or `tsv` (Tab-Separated Values). Try a few variations with the preceding command to see the difference.

## Get the IP address

Another useful command is `vm list-ip-addresses`, which lists the public and private IP addresses for a VM. If they change, or you didn't capture them during creation, you can retrieve them at any time.

```azurecli
az vm list-ip-addresses -n SampleVM -o table
```

This returns output like:

```output
VirtualMachine    PublicIPAddresses    PrivateIPAddresses
----------------  -------------------  --------------------
SampleVM          168.61.54.62         10.0.0.4
```

> [!TIP]
> Notice that we're using a shorthand syntax for the `--output` flag as `-o`. You can shorten most parameters to Azure CLI commands to a single dash and letter. For example, you can shorten `--name` to `-n` and `--resource-group` to `-g`. This is handy for entering keyboard characters, but we recommend using the full option name in scripts for clarity. Check the documentation for details about each command.

## Get VM details

We can get more detailed information about a specific virtual machine by name or ID running the `vm show` command.

```azurecli
az vm show --resource-group "myResourceGroupName" --name SampleVM
```

This returns a fairly large JSON block with all sorts of information about the VM, including attached storage devices, network interfaces, and all of the object IDs for resources that the VM is connected to. Again, we could change to a table format, but that omits almost all of the interesting data. Instead, we can turn to a built-in query language for JSON called [JMESPath](http://jmespath.org/).

## Add filters to queries with JMESPath

JMESPath is an industry-standard query language built around JSON objects. The simplest query is to specify an _identifier_ that selects a key in the JSON object.

For example, given the object:

```json
{
  "people": [
    {
      "name": "Fred",
      "age": 28
    },
    {
      "name": "Barney",
      "age": 25
    },
    {
      "name": "Wilma",
      "age": 27
    }
  ]
}
```

We can use the query `people` to return the array of values for the `people` array. If we just want _one_ of the people, we can use an indexer. For example, `people[1]` would return:

```json
{
    "name": "Barney",
    "age": 25
}
```

We can also add specific qualifiers that would return a subset of the objects based on some criteria. For example, adding the qualifier `people[?age > '25']` would return:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Fred",
    "age": 28
  },
  {
    "name": "Wilma",
    "age": 27
  }
]
```

Finally, we can constrain the results by adding a select: `people[?age > '25'].[name]` that returns just the names:

```json
[
  [
    "Fred"
  ],
  [
    "Wilma"
  ]
]
```

JMESQuery has several other interesting query features. When you have time, check out the [online tutorial](http://jmespath.org/tutorial.html) available on the [JMESPath.org](http://jmespath.org/) site.

## Filter your Azure CLI queries

With a basic understanding of JMES queries, we can add filters to the data returned by queries like the `vm show` command. For example, we can retrieve the admin username:

```azurecli
az vm show \
    --resource-group "myResourceGroupName" \
    --name SampleVM \
    --query "osProfile.adminUsername"
```

We can get the size assigned to our VM:

```azurecli
az vm show \
    --resource-group "myResourceGroupName" \
    --name SampleVM \
    --query hardwareProfile.vmSize
```

Or, to retrieve all the IDs for your network interfaces, we can run the query:

```azurecli
az vm show \
    --resource-group "myResourceGroupName" \
    --name SampleVM \
    --query "networkProfile.networkInterfaces[].id"
```

This query technique works with any Azure CLI command, and you can use it to pull specific bits of data out on the command line. It's useful for scripting, as well. For example, you can pull a value out of your Azure account and store it in an environment or script variable. If you decide to use it this way, it's useful to add the `--output tsv` parameter (which you can shorten to `-o tsv`). This will return results that only include the actual data values with tab separators.

For example:

```azurecli
az vm show \
    --resource-group "myResourceGroupName" \
    --name SampleVM \
    --query "networkProfile.networkInterfaces[].id" -o tsv
```

returns the text: `/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/bbbb1b1b-cc2c-dd3d-ee4e-ffffff5f5f5f/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/SampleVMVMNic`

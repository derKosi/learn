Azure Storage Explorer makes it easy to access and edit data in Azure.

Suppose you work for an enterprise that has developed a customer relationship management (CRM) application. The application writes data to Azure Data Lake Storage. Your software engineers occasionally need to view stored data, upload new data, and administer these storage services. They'd like to have a user-friendly tool for these activities.

In this module, you'll learn about the features of Azure Storage Explorer, how to install it, and what it can connect to. Finally, you'll use Storage Explorer to connect to Data Lake Storage to create a database and upload data.

By the end of this module, you'll know how to use Storage Explorer to manipulate data in multiple Azure services.

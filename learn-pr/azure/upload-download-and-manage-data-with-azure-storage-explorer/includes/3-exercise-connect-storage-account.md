It's easy to browse through the contents of an Azure Storage account by using Azure Storage Explorer.

Now that you have a better understanding of the features and capabilities of Storage Explorer, you can try it for yourself. Use Storage Explorer to explore some of the files that your CRM system stores in Azure Storage.

Here, you'll try Storage Explorer by downloading, installing, and connecting to an Azure Storage account. You'll create a blob and a queue in your storage account.

## Create a storage account and add a blob

1. In Azure Cloud Shell, run the following command to create a storage account. Replace **myResourceGroupName** with the name of an existing resource group, or the name of the resource group that you created for this exercise.

    ```azurecli
    az storage account create \
    --name mslearn$RANDOM \
    --resource-group "myResourceGroupName" \
    --sku Standard_GRS \
    --kind StorageV2
    ```

    In the output, note the name of the storage account. After the storage account is created, switch back to Storage Explorer.

1. If it isn't currently visible, toggle the **EXPLORER** view so that the pane is shown.

1. In the **EXPLORER** pane, select **Refresh All**, then locate and expand your subscription.

    ![Screenshot that shows the expansion of a subscription.](../media/3-storage-explorer-create-blob-1.png)

1. Locate and expand the storage account that you created earlier. It should be named something similar to **mslearn12345**, ending with a different set of numbers. It has four virtual folders: **Blob Containers**, **File Shares**, **Queues**, and **Tables**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the storage account you created earlier isn't listed, wait a few moments and select **Refresh All**; it can take a couple of minutes for the account to appear.

1. Right-click the **Blob Containers** virtual folder to access the shortcut menu, then select **Create Blob Container**.

    ![Screenshot that shows the shortcut menu options for the Blob Containers folder.](../media/3-storage-explorer-create-blob-context-menu.png)

1. Name the container **myblobcontainer** and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

    Each created container appears in a tab to the right of the resource tree.

   ![Screenshot that shows the content and details of the new myblobcontainer blob container.](../media/3-storage-explorer-create-blob-view.png)

1. Upload a blob to the container. In the **myblobcontainer** pane, select **Upload**, then select **Upload Files**. The **Upload Files** dialog box appears.

1. For **Selected files**, select the ellipsis (**...**). Browse to a small file on your device and select **Open**. Select **Upload** to upload the file.

    ![Screenshot that shows the Upload Files dialog box.](../media/3-upload-blob.png)

    You should now see your file stored in your storage account.

    ![Screenshot that shows the file in the storage account.](../media/3-upload-blob-complete.png)

From here, you can upload additional files, download files, make copies, and do other administrative tasks.

## Create a queue in your Azure Storage account

To create a queue in your storage account:

1. In the resource tree, find your subscription and expand the options.

1. Expand the **cloudshell** storage account.

1. Right-click the **Queues** virtual folder to access the shortcut menu, then select **Create Queue**.

1. An empty and unnamed queue is created inside the **Queues** folder. The queue won't be created until you give it a name.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Containers have specific rules that govern how they can be named. They must begin and end with either a letter or a number, must be all lowercase, and can have numbers and hyphens. The name can't contain a double hyphen.

    Name this new queue **myqueue** and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to create the queue. Each created queue appears on a tab to the right of the resource tree.

    ![Screenshot that shows the content and details of the new myblob blob container.](../media/3-storage-explorer-create-queue-view.png)

    From this view, you can manage the queue's content. If our application used this queue and experienced an issue with processing a message, you could connect to the queue and view the message contents to determine the issue.

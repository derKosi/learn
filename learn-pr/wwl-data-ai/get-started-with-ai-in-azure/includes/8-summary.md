In this module, you learned about the main parts and best practices for getting started with AI in Microsoft Foundry. By using Azure’s scalable infrastructure and Foundry’s unified platform, organizations can speed up the development and launch of generative AI applications and intelligent agents. Foundry’s collection of ready-to-use models, built-in tools, and governance features helps developers create secure, responsible, and high-performing AI solutions.

In this module, we've introduced Azure, Microsoft's cloud service for global scale software applications, and learned about Microsoft Foundry, a platform for building AI apps and agents on Azure. With this foundational knowledge, you can start to explore how to use Foundry to deploy and work with generative AI models, develop agents, and integrate AI capabilities like speech and computer vision.

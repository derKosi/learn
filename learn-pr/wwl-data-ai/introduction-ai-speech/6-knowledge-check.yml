  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What activity happens during the pre-processing stage of speech recognition?"
    choices:
    - content: "The audio is converted to .wmv format."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Conversion to .wmv format isn't required."
    - content: "Background noise is added to the audio signal."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Background noise isn't added to the audio signal during pre-processing."
    - content: "Feature vectors are extracted from the audio waveform for modeling."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Feature vectors, often MFCCs, are extracted from the audio waveform for modeling."
  - content: "What are *phonemes*?"
    choices:
    - content: "Artifacts that are removed from the signal as part of the clean-up process."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Phonemes aren't artifacts in the audio signal."
    - content: "The smallest unit of sound in speech."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Phonemes are the smallest unit of sound in speech."
    - content: "AI models that generate audio."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Phonemes aren't AI models."
  - content: "Why is it important to generate prosody in speech synthesis?"
    choices:
    - content: "Prosody maximizes the volume of the audio output."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Prosody doesn't maximize volume"
    - content: "Prosody translates the speech to the language of the listener."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Prosody doesn't translate speech to another language."
    - content: "Prosody ensures natural pronunciation and speech cadence."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Prosody ensures natural pronunciation and speech cadence."

Speech is one of the most natural ways humans communicate, and bringing speech capabilities to AI applications creates more intuitive, accessible, and engaging user experiences. Whether you're building a voice assistant, creating accessible applications, or developing conversational AI agents, understanding speech technologies is essential for modern AI solutions.

In this module, you'll explore the two fundamental speech capabilities that power voice-enabled applications: **speech recognition** (converting spoken words to text) and **speech synthesis** (converting text to natural-sounding speech). You'll discover how these technologies work together to create seamless voice interactions and learn about the real-world scenarios where speech can transform user experiences.

  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Your organization needs to ensure the Finance team can only access their data from designated workspaces while physically storing that data in separate Azure storage containers. Which combination of Unity Catalog isolation methods should you implement?"
    choices:
    - content: "Administrative roles and catalog-level permissions only"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This approach doesn't restrict workspace access or provide physical data separation in storage."
    - content: "Workspace-to-catalog binding and Azure storage separation"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Workspace-to-catalog binding limits catalog visibility to specific workspaces, while Azure storage separation ensures data is physically isolated in different ADLS Gen2 containers."
    - content: "Schema-level permissions and metastore admin roles"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Schema-level permissions don't provide workspace isolation, and metastore admin roles are for overall governance, not team-specific access control."
    - content: "Storage credentials and external locations only"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While this provides storage separation, it doesn't control which workspaces can access the catalogs."

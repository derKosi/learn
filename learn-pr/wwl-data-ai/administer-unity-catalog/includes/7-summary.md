In this module, you learned how to implement Unity Catalog's governance controls to manage data access across multiple teams and workspaces.

You configured isolation boundaries using administrative roles, workspace-to-catalog binding, and storage separation. These controls give you precise management over who can access data, which workspaces can use specific catalogs, and where data is physically stored.

You explored Unity Catalog's automatic lineage tracking, which captures data flow between tables, views, pipelines, and notebooks. This visibility helps you assess the impact of changes before modifying schemas or data sources, preventing unexpected downstream effects.

You also learned how to transition from the Hive metastore to Unity Catalog while maintaining existing Hive table functionality while you build new governed assets in Unity Catalog, ensuring smooth migration without workflow disruption.

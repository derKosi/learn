# Introduction

Imagine your organization as a large apartment building where different departments need their own secure spaces, yet sometimes they need to collaborate and share resources. Unity Catalog's isolation strategies work similarly—they provide administrative boundaries that keep data secure while enabling controlled collaboration across teams.

## Learning scenario

You're the senior data administrator for GlobalTech Solutions, a multinational corporation with subsidiaries in healthcare, finance, and retail. Each division has strict compliance requirements, but they occasionally need to collaborate on cross-functional analytics projects. Your challenge is implementing Unity Catalog isolation strategies that satisfy both security and collaboration needs.

The finance team processes sensitive customer transaction data that must remain completely isolated due to SOX compliance. Healthcare manages patient records requiring HIPAA protection. Meanwhile, the retail division wants to share customer behavior insights with both teams for comprehensive analytics. You need to design an administrative architecture that enables this complex scenario while maintaining regulatory compliance.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll master the three core isolation methods in Unity Catalog:

- **Workspace-level separation** - Like having separate floors in our apartment building
- **Metastore isolation** - Like having completely separate buildings for different tenant groups
- **Account-level boundaries** - Like having entirely different properties for maximum security

You'll also explore how data lineage tracking integrates with legacy Hive tables during migration, ensuring you maintain visibility into data flows even as you modernize your architecture.

## What's the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll confidently design and implement Unity Catalog isolation strategies that balance security requirements with operational efficiency. You'll understand when to use each isolation method and how to maintain data lineage visibility throughout your organization's Unity Catalog journey.

Think of this as becoming the architect who designs secure, efficient data communities within your organization—enabling the right people to access the right data at the right time, while keeping everything properly isolated and compliant.

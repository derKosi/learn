Imagine you're the data platform administrator for a rapidly growing company that started with separate Azure Databricks workspaces for each department. Your finance team has been using Hive metastore tables for quarterly reporting, while your marketing team built customer analytics in their own workspace, and your data engineering team manages the company's medallion architecture pipelines in yet another workspace.

As the company scales, you're facing several challenges: teams can't easily share data across workspaces, you have no visibility into how changes to one table might impact downstream reports, and managing permissions across multiple Hive metastores is becoming unmanageable. Leadership has asked you to implement Unity Catalog to solve these governance challenges while ensuring minimal disruption to existing workflows.

In this module, you learn how to address these challenges by implementing Unity Catalog's governance capabilities. You'll discover how to control data access through isolation boundaries, track data lineage to understand dependencies, and smoothly transition from your existing Hive metastore setup to Unity Catalog's centralized governance model.

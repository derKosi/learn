You've learned how to develop AI agents using Microsoft Foundry Agent Service through both the Azure portal and Visual Studio Code. These flexible development approaches enable you to create intelligent automation that handles complex tasks, accesses real-time data, and integrates seamlessly with your applications.

Throughout this module, you discovered what AI agents are and why they're valuable for automating workflows and enhancing decision-making. You explored the key features of Microsoft Foundry Agent Service, including automatic tool calling, secure data management, and enterprise-grade security. You learned to build agents using both the visual Azure portal and the developer-focused VS Code extension, understanding when each approach fits best.

You configured agents with clear instructions that define their behavior and personality. You extended agent capabilities by adding tools like Code Interpreter, File Search, and Bing Search, transforming simple chat interfaces into sophisticated automation systems. You tested agents using integrated playgrounds, deployed them to production environments, and generated integration code to connect agents with your applications.

With these skills, you can create AI agents that automate routine tasks, provide intelligent assistance, and integrate with your existing systems. Whether you're building customer service automation, developer productivity tools, or specialized research assistants, Microsoft Foundry Agent Service provides the foundation for reliable, scalable AI solutions.

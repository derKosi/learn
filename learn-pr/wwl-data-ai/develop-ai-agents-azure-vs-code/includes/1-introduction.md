Imagine you work for a healthcare organization that needs to automate patient interactions while maintaining high security standards. You need an AI agent that can handle patient inquiries, schedule appointments, and access real-time medical information. Building such a system traditionally requires extensive infrastructure management, significant coding effort, and careful attention to data security. Microsoft Foundry Agent Service offers a solution that simplifies this complexity while maintaining enterprise-grade security.

Microsoft Foundry Agent Service is a fully managed platform that empowers you to build, deploy, and scale AI agents without managing underlying compute and storage resources. Whether you prefer working through the Azure portal or developing directly in Visual Studio Code, you have flexible options for creating intelligent agents that automate workflows and enhance user experiences.

In this module, you'll learn how to develop AI agents using both the Azure portal and the Microsoft Foundry extension for Visual Studio Code. You'll discover how to configure agents with custom instructions, extend their capabilities with tools, and integrate them into your applications. By the end, you'll be able to choose the right development approach for your scenarios and deploy production-ready AI agents.

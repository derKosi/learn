Now it's your opportunity to Secure Data in Azure Databricks Unity Catalog. In this exercise, you'll use a provided script to provision an Azure Databricks workspace in your Azure subscription; and then use a notebook to explore two powerful Unity Catalog security features that go beyond basic access control:

- **Row Filtering and Column Masking**: Learn how to protect sensitive data at the table level by hiding specific rows or masking column values based on user permissions

- **Dynamic Views**: Create intelligent views that automatically adjust what data users can see based on their group memberships and access levels

> [!NOTE]
> To complete this lab, you'll need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free?azure-portal=true) in which you have administrative access.

Launch the exercise and follow the instructions.

* Fine-grained access control lets you expose only parts of a dataset—masking sensitive columns, filtering rows, or partially transforming values—without duplicating tables or maintaining many extracts.
* Databricks Unity Catalog offers two approaches: **Row & Column Security** (modern, preferred) and **Dynamic Views** (earlier pattern that still fits some cases).
* **Row & Column Security** binds masking functions to columns and a filter function to the table, centralizing rules with the data for simpler governance, fewer objects, and better performance.
* **Dynamic Views** embed CASE logic and predicates in views to present curated, read-only projections—useful for multi-table compositions or when you want a strict presentation layer that hides base tables.
* Default to Row & Column Security to reduce object sprawl and maintenance; choose Dynamic Views when you need a multi-table interface, a hard abstraction boundary, or to support legacy patterns.
* Common pitfalls: duplicating tables per audience, proliferating near-duplicate views, placing heavy business logic inside masking functions, under-securing the functions themselves, and over-masking to the point of harming analytical utility.

Unity Catalog supports **fine-grained access control** so different users can query the same table but see only what they’re allowed. Two main approaches are used:

* **Row and Column Security** – rules are attached directly to a table.

  * *Column masking* hides sensitive values unless a user is in an authorized group.
  * *Row filtering* restricts which rows a user can see based on group membership.

* **Dynamic Views** – a view definition encodes masking and filtering logic in SQL. Users query the view and automatically see only the permitted subset of data, while the base table remains unchanged.

**Key difference:** table-level controls ensure restrictions apply everywhere the table is used, while dynamic views allow flexible, audience-specific projections. Use Row and Column Security for strict enforcement, and dynamic views for adaptable or multi-audience scenarios.

Lakehouse Monitoring provides a structured way to evaluate and maintain confidence in both data quality and model performance. By automatically generating metrics, dashboards, and alerts, it reduces the need for manual analysis and helps teams detect issues earlier. Whether you are tracking the health of a production dataset, validating time series consistency, or ensuring that deployed models continue to perform as expected, Lakehouse Monitoring offers an integrated, end-to-end solution for reliable data-to-AI pipelines.

Data quality monitoring is an ongoing process, but with tools like Lakehouse Monitoring automating much of the heavy lifting, maintaining high-quality data becomes a much more achievable (and even routine) part of the data lifecycle. By catching issues early — as soon as a bad batch of data arrives — we avoid costly downstream consequences and ensure that our analytics and machine learning outcomes are built on a solid foundation of reliable data.

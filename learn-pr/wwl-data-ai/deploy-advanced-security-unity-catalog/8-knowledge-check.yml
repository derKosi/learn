  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Why is fine-grained access control important in modern data platforms?"
    choices:
    - content: "Because it allows you to grant or deny access to entire tables without needing any additional rules."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Granting or denying access to entire tables is too coarse-grained for most real scenarios."
    - content: "Because it helps expose only the necessary parts of datasets to different users while protecting sensitive data."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Fine-grained access control lets you tailor what users see at the row and column level, reducing duplication and improving security."
    - content: "Because it automatically removes all sensitive data from the dataset."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Fine-grained access control doesn't remove dataâ€”it controls how and to whom it's exposed."

  - content: "What is the main reason **Row and Column Security** is preferred over **Dynamic Views**?"
    choices:
    - content: "It completely replaces the need for group-based access checks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Both approaches rely on group membership or similar checks to enforce access rules."
    - content: "It centralizes masking and filtering logic at the table level, reducing object sprawl, and improving governance."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Row and Column Security keeps rules close to the data, simplifying maintenance and improving performance."
    - content: "It allows creating multiple separate views for each user group."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. That is actually one of the downsides of using views, not a feature of Row and Column Security."

  - content: "How does **Lakehouse Monitoring** help maintain data quality over time?"
    choices:
    - content: "By automatically deleting rows with anomalies."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Lakehouse Monitoring doesn't modify data; it tracks metrics and detects issues."
    - content: "By replacing dashboards with automated reports."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Dashboards are a key part of Lakehouse Monitoring and aren't replaced."
    - content: "By profiling tables, tracking metrics like null percentages and value distributions, and detecting drift over time."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Lakehouse Monitoring provides visibility into data quality trends and alerts teams to potential problems."

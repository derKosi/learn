title: Implement Advanced Security and Data Management in Unity Catalog
summary: You explore different features and tools to help you implement advanced security and data management in Unity Catalog.
abstract: |
  At the end of this module, you're able to:
  *	Explain the importance of fine-grained access control and distinguish between Row and Column Security and Dynamic Views.
  *	Implement masking and filtering rules at the table level using Row and Column Security, and identify scenarios where Dynamic Views are appropriate.
  *	Use Lakehouse Monitoring to profile data, detect anomalies such as nulls, zeros, and outliers, and interpret quality and drift metrics over time.
prerequisites: |
  * Basic understanding of data lakehouse concepts (catalogs, schemas, tables, views).
  * Familiarity with Azure Databricks workspace navigation (clusters, SQL warehouses, notebooks).
  * Introductory knowledge of SQL (running queries, creating tables, granting permissions).

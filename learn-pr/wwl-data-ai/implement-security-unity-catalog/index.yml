title: Implement Security and Access Control in Unity Catalog
summary: You explore different features and tools to help you implement security and access control in Unity Catalog.
abstract: |
  At the end of this module, you're able to:
  * Describe the Unity Catalog query lifecycle and where access checks occur.
  * Distinguish explicit grants from inherited privileges and state when each is appropriate.
  * Identify the minimum privileges required for common tasks (querying, creating tables).
  * Compare Unity Catalog authorization to a legacy Hive metastore approach.
  * Apply a repeatable pattern for granting and auditing access.
prerequisites: |
  * Basic understanding of data lakehouse concepts (catalogs, schemas, tables, views).
  * Familiarity with Azure Databricks workspace navigation (clusters, SQL warehouses, notebooks).
  * Introductory knowledge of SQL (running queries, creating tables, granting permissions).

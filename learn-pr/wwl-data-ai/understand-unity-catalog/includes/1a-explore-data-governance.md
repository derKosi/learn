# Explore data governance using Unity Catalog

## Why is data governance so challenging?

Modern enterprises face significant challenges when managing data across multiple platforms and storage types. Data is often spread across data lakes, data warehouses, and various analytics and AI tools, each with their own governance models, permission systems, and metadata management. This fragmented approach leads to several critical issues:

**Data duplication and drift**: Data is copied between lakes and warehouses, causing inconsistencies. Organizations often employ a data lake alongside a data warehouse, which leads to data duplication and data drift as information becomes out of sync across platforms.

**Fragmented governance**: Permissions and policies must be managed separately at the file, table, and view level, often with different tools and models. In typical enterprise environments:

- **Data lakes** use file and directory-level permissions where you set permissions on files and directories, meaning you cannot set fine-grained permissions on rows and columns
- **Data warehouses** provide table and column-level security with different governance models  
- **Analytics tools** like dashboards, machine learning models, and notebooks each have their own permission models and tech stacks

**Limited fine-grained control**: Data lakes typically only allow file/folder-level permissions, not row/column-level control. Because governance controls are at the file level, data teams must carefully structure their data layout to support desired policies. When governance rules change, organizations may need to restructure all directories and files, making policy changes extremely complex.

**Silos and complexity**: Each system has its own access controls, making it hard to audit, share, or change policies consistently. You might have permissions on files that don't correspond to permissions on tables made from those files, or vice versa.

**Multi-cloud and multi-tool sprawl**: Different clouds and tools add even more layers of access management complexity, with each platform requiring separate governance approaches.

## What is data governance?

Now that we understand the challenges, let's define what effective data governance should accomplish. Data governance refers to the process of managing the availability, usability, integrity, and security of data. In today's data-driven landscape, governance has become essential for establishing trustworthy data that is readily accessible to those who need it, while following internal policies and external regulatory requirements.

Effective data governance tools provide four essential capabilities:

**Data Access Control**: Decide who can see or use specific data, such as files, tables, or machine learning models, so only the right people have access based on their roles and responsibilities.

**Data Access Auditing**: Track who accessed data, when, and how, to support security investigations, compliance reporting, and understanding usage patterns across the organization.

**Data Lineage**: See where data comes from and how it moves through your systems, making it easier to troubleshoot issues, understand data dependencies, and trust the accuracy of reports and analytics.

**Data Discovery**: Make it easy to find and understand what data you have, even in large and complex environments, so teams can locate relevant datasets without duplicating efforts.

## How Unity Catalog solves these challenges

Unity Catalog addresses all these governance challenges by providing a single, unified layer for managing data and AI assets across your entire Databricks environment. Instead of juggling multiple systems with different permission models, Unity Catalog gives you one central place to control access, even across different workspaces and cloud regions.

Unity Catalog eliminates governance complexity through four key approaches:

**Unified governance model**: Define your access rules once and apply them consistently across all workspaces, programming languages, and data types - no more synchronizing policies across different systems.

**Automatic enforcement and tracking**: Access controls are enforced automatically whenever data is accessed, while comprehensive auditing and data lineage capture happen automatically across all your data operations.

**Centralized management**: Manage all your data assets from one location using familiar SQL commands or an intuitive interface, regardless of where your data actually resides.

**Fine-grained control**: Set permissions at the table, column, or even row level - far beyond the file-level limitations of traditional data lakes.

In essence, Unity Catalog acts like a unified security and organization system for all your data, eliminating the fragmentation and complexity that makes traditional data governance so challenging.

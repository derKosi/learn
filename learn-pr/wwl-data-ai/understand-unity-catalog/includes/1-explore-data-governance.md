Enterprises today manage data across multiple clouds, platforms, and tools — including data lakes, data warehouses, ML pipelines, and analytics dashboards. Each typically comes with its own governance model, permissions system, and metadata management, leading to:

**Data duplication and drift**: Organizations often copy data between lakes and warehouses, which can result in inconsistencies and data becoming out of sync.

**Fragmented governance**: Different systems (storage, databases, analytics) require separate permission models. For example:

 - Object storage (data lakes) typically uses file and directory-level access control. Fine-grained permissions (row/column) are not natively supported without additional governance layers.

 - Data warehouses provide table and column-level access, but with a different model than the lake.

 - Analytics and ML tools each have their own user- and workspace-level permission models.

**Limited fine-grained control**: File-level governance in lakes means data layout must be carefully structured to simulate policy requirements. Policy changes often require restructuring directories and files, which is complex.

**Silos and complexity**: Access rules may not align across systems. For example, file permissions might not match table permissions built on top of those files.

**Multi-cloud and multi-tool sprawl**: Governance grows even more complex when managing across clouds, tools, and vendor ecosystems.

## What Is Data Governance?

Data governance is the discipline of ensuring data is available, usable, consistent, trustworthy, and secure. It balances internal policy and external compliance requirements while making data accessible to the right people.

Effective governance solutions provide four core capabilities:

1. **Access Control** – Define *who can do what* with which data assets (files, tables, ML models, dashboards).
2. **Access Auditing** – Track *who accessed what, when, and how* for security investigations, compliance, and usage insights.
3. **Data Lineage** – Trace where data originates, how it flows, and how it is transformed, enabling trust and troubleshooting.
4. **Data Discovery** – Make datasets searchable and understandable, reducing duplication and accelerating analysis.

## How Unity Catalog Solves These Challenges

Azure Databricks' Unity Catalog is the unified governance layer for the lakehouse, covering both data and AI assets. Instead of multiple disconnected governance systems, it provides a single model across all workspaces in a region.

Unity Catalog addresses governance challenges through:

 - **Unified governance model**:
      - Define policies once and apply them consistently across workspaces, data types, and programming languages.
      - Based on a standard ANSI SQL GRANT / REVOKE model.
 - **Fine-grained permissions**:
      - Control access at the catalog, schema, table, view, and column level.
      - Row-level security is possible via policies and views, though it is not emphasized as a primary built-in feature in all cases.
      - Permissions cascade logically through Unity Catalog's object hierarchy: Metastore → Catalog → Schema → Objects.
 - **Centralized management**:
    - All securable objects (tables, views, volumes, models, external locations, connections, storage credentials) can be governed in one place.
    - Workspaces in the same region/metastore share a unified governance framework.
 - **Automatic auditing and lineage**:
    -  Unity Catalog automatically logs access in system tables for auditing.
    - It captures data lineage across notebooks, jobs, dashboards, and queries.
 -  **Federated governance**:
    - Unity Catalog can also govern access to external databases and federated catalogs, extending policies beyond native Databricks-managed assets.

In modern data platforms, granting or denying access to entire tables is rarely sufficient to meet real-world security and governance needs. Organizations must often expose only a subset of data, protecting sensitive information while maintaining analytical utility. Databricks Unity Catalog provides robust **fine-grained access control** mechanisms that allow you to manage data visibility at the row and column level without duplicating datasets or creating unnecessary complexity. 

In this module, you'll explore the two primary approaches—**Row and Column Security** and **Dynamic Views**—understand when to use each, and see why modern architectures favor table-level controls. You'll also learn how **Lakehouse Monitoring** supports ongoing data quality and model performance tracking, ensuring that your lakehouse remains secure, reliable, and transparent as data evolves.

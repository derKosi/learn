Fine-grained access control and continuous monitoring are essential components of a secure and trustworthy data platform. By applying **Row and Column Security**, you can centralize masking and filtering rules at the table level, simplifying governance, and improving performance. **Dynamic Views** remain useful in scenarios that require strict abstraction or multi-table compositions. **Lakehouse Monitoring** complements these security controls by providing visibility into data quality and model behavior over time, enabling teams to detect anomalies, track drift, and respond proactively to issues. 

Together, these capabilities help maintain both the integrity and the utility of data, ensuring that different users can safely access the information they need while sensitive details remain protected.

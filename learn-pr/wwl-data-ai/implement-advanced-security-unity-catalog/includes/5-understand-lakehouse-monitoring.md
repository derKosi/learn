Lakehouse Monitoring in Databricks provides a way to continuously assess the quality of data and the performance of machine learning models within your environment. By attaching monitors to tables or inference logs, you can track changes in data distributions, detect drift, and evaluate model performance over time. This monitoring capability ensures that data-driven applications remain reliable, transparent, and easy to diagnose when issues arise.

## What is Lakehouse Monitoring?

Lakehouse Monitoring is designed to help data practitioners and consumers understand how their data and models behave as they evolve. A monitor can be attached to any Delta table, and depending on the type of data, you can generate different types of analyses:

- **Snapshot analysis**: Provides a one-time assessment of a table's current quality and statistical properties.

- **Time series analysis**: Evaluates tables with timestamped data, tracking how data quality metrics change across time windows.

- **Inference analysis**: Focuses on tables that store model inputs and predictions, allowing you to measure model drift and performance over time.

Once a monitor is created, Databricks automatically generates metric tables and a dashboard that summarize the results. This makes it possible to examine statistics, visualize changes, and configure alerts when thresholds are exceeded.

## Why Monitor Data and Models?

Reliable machine learning and analytics depend on the consistency and integrity of the underlying data. Monitoring provides quantitative measures of data quality and helps you spot issues early. Key benefits include:

- **Data integrity checks**: Identify fractions of missing values, zeros, or unexpected values, and track how these proportions change over time.
  
- **Statistical distribution tracking**: Evaluate numerical distributions (such as percentiles or standard deviations) or categorical distributions (such as value frequencies).

- **Drift detection**: Compare current data to a known baseline, such as training or validation data, to see whether the distribution has shifted significantly.

- **Model performance monitoring**: Assess metrics like precision, recall, or F1 score across inference tables to understand how models perform in production compared to baseline datasets.

These insights help data teams and business stakeholders determine when data issues or model degradation may require attention.

## Components of Lakehouse Monitoring

When you set up monitoring, several components work together to provide visibility:

- **Primary table**: The dataset being monitored. This could be a production Delta table, a time series dataset, or an inference log.
- **Optional baseline table**: A reference dataset used for drift comparisons. For example, the baseline could be the training data used for a machine learning model.
- **Metric tables**: Two types of metric tables are created:
   - A **profile metrics table**, which stores summary statistics about the dataset.
   - A **drift metrics table**, which captures changes in the distribution of the data compared to previous time windows or a baseline.
- **Dashboard**: Automatically generated in Databricks, the dashboard visualizes the results from the metric tables. It supports filtering by time range, column, and slice of data, and can be extended with SQL alerts.

## Typical Use Cases

Monitoring plays a crucial role in maintaining the reliability of data and models across different scenarios. It helps detect **data drift**, such as shifts in the distribution of categorical or numerical values over time, which could signal that a dataset no longer resembles its baseline. It also supports tracking of **missing or invalid values**, making it easier to spot when nulls or zeros begin to accumulate in important fields that downstream processes depend on.

Beyond data quality, monitoring also contributes to **model stability** by comparing current predictions against training baselines and flagging performance declines before they affect production outcomes. Finally, it strengthens **governance and compliance** by capturing lineage information in Unity Catalog, allowing teams to trace how data changes ripple through pipelines, models, and dashboards. This provides both transparency and accountability when working with sensitive or regulated datasets.

## Working with Dashboards and Alerts

Dashboards generated by Lakehouse Monitoring provide visual access to metrics such as row counts, null percentages, and drift statistics. They can be filtered by time ranges and subsets of data to better understand specific trends.

In addition, Databricks allows you to set up alerts based on metric thresholds. For instance, you might configure an alert to notify you when the proportion of nulls in a column exceeds 20%, or when the F1 score of a model drops below a set level. These proactive alerts allow teams to respond quickly rather than waiting for downstream failures to surface.

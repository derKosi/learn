summary: Learn how to optimize query performance by analyzing query patterns, configuring range and composite indexes, selecting vector index types, and choosing consistency levels that balance freshness with cost efficiency.
abstract: |
  After completing this module, you'll be able to:
    - Analyze query patterns and use metrics to identify performance bottlenecks and missing indexes
    - Configure range and composite indexes to optimize filter and sort operations for AI retrieval patterns
    - Select the appropriate vector index type based on dataset size, accuracy requirements, and performance goals
    - Design indexing policies that balance read performance against write costs for your workload profile
    - Choose consistency levels that meet application requirements while minimizing RU consumption
prerequisites: |
  Before beginning this module, you should have:
  - Programming experience with languages such as Python, JavaScript, or C#
  - Basic understanding of Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL concepts including containers, items, and partition keys
  - Familiarity with SQL query syntax for filtering and sorting data

title: Understand Microsoft Fabric IQ fundamentals
summary: Microsoft Fabric IQ provides a way to define business vocabulary in an ontology and bind the ontology to data sources. Learn about ontology items, data agents, Graph in Microsoft Fabric, and Power BI semantic models. Discover how ontology modeling differs from traditional analytical modeling by starting with business concepts rather than specific use cases.

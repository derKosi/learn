Microsoft Fabric IQ lets you define business vocabulary once in ontologies, enabling natural language queries and graph visualization of your data. In this module, you learned what Fabric IQ is, how to access it, and how it fits within Microsoft Fabric's data platform.

You explored the build-bind-query workflow for creating ontologies: defining entity types and relationships, binding them to lakehouse tables and eventhouse streams, and querying them through Graph or data agents. You also saw how to generate ontologies from existing Power BI semantic models or build them from scratch using OneLake data.

You examined four components that work together: ontology items define your business vocabulary, data agents answer natural language questions across multiple data sources, Graph in Microsoft Fabric visualizes and analyzes relationships, and Power BI semantic models can generate initial ontology structures.

Finally, you learned how ontology modeling differs from traditional analytical modeling. Instead of starting with specific reporting needs and designing tables optimized for queries, ontology modeling starts with core business concepts and their relationships. This concept-driven approach creates reusable definitions that both data agents and Graph can use, enabling business users to explore data using familiar terminology.

Microsoft Fabric IQ provides a way to define business vocabulary in ontologies and bind them to data sources. Instead of teams building separate interpretations of business concepts, you define entity types, properties, and relationships once in an ontology, then bind them to data sources. This approach provides a semantic layer that data agents and Graph in Microsoft Fabric can use.

You explored how Fabric IQ brings together complementary components: ontology items establish your business vocabulary, data agents enable natural language queries, and Graph visualizes and analyzes relationships. Each component serves a distinct role while working together through the unified ontology foundation.

The ontology modeling paradigm shifts focus from use-case-driven modeling to concept-driven modeling. Traditional analytical data modeling starts with specific reporting and analytics needs—designing tables optimized for particular queries. Ontology modeling inverts this by starting with core business concepts and their relationships, then binding those definitions to data sources. Entity types provide reusable conceptual definitions, properties standardize terminology across tables, and relationships make connections explicit rather than buried in join logic. Data binding creates a semantic layer that references actual data without copying or moving it—queries execute against source systems (lakehouses, eventhouses) at query time.

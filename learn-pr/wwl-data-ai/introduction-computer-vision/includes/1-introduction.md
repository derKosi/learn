**Computer vision** is one of the core areas of artificial intelligence (AI), and focuses on creating solutions that enable AI applications to process visual information.

Consider these scenarios: 

- An autonomous vehicle needs to detect and respond to traffic and pedestrians.
- A store uses smart checkouts with cameras to determine the products in a customers basket.
- A doorbell camera is used to detect people at your front door.

These use cases, and many others, rely on computer vision.

Of course, computers don't have biological eyes that work the way ours do, but they're capable of processing images; either from a live camera feed or from digital photographs or videos. This ability to process images is the key to creating software that can emulate human visual perception. In this module, we'll examine the building blocks that underlie modern computer vision solutions.

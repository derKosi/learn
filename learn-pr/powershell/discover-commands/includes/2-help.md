By using the built-in help system in PowerShell, you can find out more about a specific command. You use the `Get-Command` cmdlet to locate a command that you need. After you've located the command, you might want to know more about what the command does and various ways to call it.

## Discover cmdlets by using the help system and Get-Help

You can use the `Get-Help` core cmdlet to learn more about a command. Typically, you invoke `Get-Help` by specifying it by name and adding the `-Name` flag that contains the name of the cmdlet you want to learn about. Here's an example:

```powershell
Get-Help -Name Get-Help
```

### Update help

New versions of PowerShell don't include the help system by default. The first time you run `Get-Help`, you're asked to install the help files. You can also run the `Update-Help` cmdlet to install the help files. Because a call to `Update-Help` downloads many help files, the command can fetch only once per day by default. You can override this fetching behavior by using the `-Force` flag.

You update the help files differently on Windows compared to Linux or macOS. The process differs because when you run the `Update-Help` cmdlet, help files are fetched over the internet by matching your computer's culture. On Windows, a culture is already installed, but it's missing on Linux and macOS. So you need to specify a culture when you update help files on Linux and macOS.

Here's an example command:

```powershell
Update-Help -UICulture en-US -Verbose
```

This command specifies the `-UICulture` flag. It gives it the value `en-US`, which fetches US English help files. To update your help files on macOS or Linux, use a culture that corresponds to your machine's culture.

### Explore help sections

When you invoke `Get-Help` on a cmdlet, a help page is returned. The page includes many sections. You'll likely see these common sections:

- **NAME**: Provides the name of the command.
- **SYNTAX**: Shows ways to call the command by using a combination of flags, and sometimes, allowed parameters.
- **ALIASES**: Lists any aliases for a command. An alias is a different name for a command, and it can be used to invoke the command.
- **REMARKS**: Provides information about what commands to run to get more help for this command.
- **PARAMETERS**: Provides details about the parameter. It lists its type, a longer description, and acceptable values, if applicable.

### Filter the help response

If you don't want to display the full help page, narrow the response by adding flags to your `Get-Help` command. Here are some flags you can use:

- **Full**: Returns a detailed help page. It specifies information like parameters, inputs, and outputs that you don't get in the standard response.
- **Detailed**: Returns a response that looks like the standard response, but it includes a section for parameters.
- **Examples**: Returns only examples, if any exist.
- **Online**: Opens a web page for your command.
- **Parameter**: Requires a parameter name as an argument. It lists a specific parameter's properties.

For example, you can use the following command to return only the Examples section of the help page.

```powershell
Get-Help Get-FileHash -Examples
```  

### Improve the reading experience

Running `Get-Help` returns the entire help page. The page might not provide the best reading experience. You might have to scroll to find the section you want to read. A better approach is to use the `help` alias. The `help` alias pipes `Get-Help` into a function that ensures that your output is readable line by line. It also makes the response readable page by page, by paginating the output. You'll use the `help` alias in the next unit.

In this module, you learn the basics of PowerShell scripting. Scripting is about automation. It's about storing steps that you do often in a file. By running files that contain your scripts, you can save time and reuse existing solutions. You can then spend that time on something more valuable. 

By the end of this module, you'll know some helpful constructs of the PowerShell language and how you can use them to create and run scripts.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Write and run scripts.
- Use variables and parameters to make your scripts flexible.
- Apply flow-control logic to make intelligent decisions.
- Add robustness to your scripts by adding error management.

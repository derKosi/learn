In PowerShell, you run compiled commands, or _cmdlets_. By connecting these cmdlets, you can create powerful combined statements, or _pipelines_. You'll find such combined statements useful as you're looking to automate your workflows.

As part of creating these pipelines, it's beneficial to understand how to format the output to your liking. For example, a carefully selected output format might allow you to quickly get an overview of a situation, or make it easier to fit the output into a report.

When you learn to combine cmdlets, you unlock much of the power that's built into PowerShell.

## Learning objectives

After you complete this module, you'll be able to:

- Explore cmdlets further and construct a sequence of them in a pipeline.
- Apply sound principles to your commands by using _filtering_ and _formatting_.

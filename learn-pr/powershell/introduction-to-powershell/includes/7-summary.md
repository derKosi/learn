In this module, you started by learning what PowerShell is and what you can use it for. You explored its primary features and learned how to run your first commands. You then learned about compiled commands called cmdlets. You looked specifically at a command called `Get-Command` that helps you locate the command you need.

You should now have a good understanding of PowerShell, what it's used for, and how to use its commands efficiently.

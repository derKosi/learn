  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "When you resample the audio, you are..."
      choices:
        - content: "Increasing the size."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect."
        - content: "Reducing the size."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! We can reduce the size of the file by reducing the sample rate for the audio track."
    - content: "What is a spectrogram?"
      choices:
        - content: "Maps the frequency to time of an audio file."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct!"
        - content: "The audio channels."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect."
        - content: "Sample rate and frequency visualized."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect this is a waveform."
    - content: "Audio classification can only be done with computer vision on spectrograms."
      choices:
        - content: "True"
          isCorrect: False
          explanation: "Incorrect. There's more than one way to build audio classification models."
        - content: "False"
          isCorrect: True
          explanation: "Correct! There's more than one way to build audio classification models."

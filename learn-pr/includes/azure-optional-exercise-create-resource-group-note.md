> To complete the steps in this exercise, you'll need to use a resource group. You can use a resource group that you've already created, or you can create a new resource group that you'll use specifically for this exercise. If you choose to create a new resource group, that will make it easier to clean up any resources that you create as you complete the steps in this exercise. If you don't have an existing resource group or you'd like to create one for this exercise, you can follow the steps in [Use the Azure portal and Azure Resource Manager to manage resource groups](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal) to create a resource group by using the Azure portal, or you can follow the steps in [Manage Azure resource groups by using Azure CLI](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-cli) to create a resource group by using the the Azure portal.

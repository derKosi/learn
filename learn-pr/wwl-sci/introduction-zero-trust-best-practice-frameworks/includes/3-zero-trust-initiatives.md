Implementing Zero Trust across an organization is a major transformation. It requires a structured approach that goes beyond deploying individual technologies. Microsoft provides two complementary approaches: the Zero Trust adoption framework for strategic planning and the Rapid Modernization Plan (RaMP) for quick wins.

## Zero Trust adoption framework

The Zero Trust adoption framework helps organizations plan and execute a Zero Trust strategy across their entire digital estate. It adapts the lifecycle phases from the Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure, but with a scope suited to Zero Trust.

Adopting a Zero Trust strategy requires buy-in from across the C-suite. Security isn't the responsibility of one team—it's a shared business responsibility aligned to business outcomes. Each C-level role has a stake in Zero Trust, from the CEO who needs an integrated approach to security, to the CFO who needs measurable accountability for security spend.

The Zero Trust adoption framework uses these lifecycle phases:

| Phase | Description |
|---|---|
| **Define strategy** | Build a business case focused on the outcomes most closely aligned with your organization's risks and strategic goals. |
| **Plan** | Prioritize quick wins and incremental progress. Structure coherent initiatives with clear outcomes, benefits, and ownership. |
| **Ready** | Create a multilayer strategy for your Zero Trust deployment and prioritize early actions based on business needs. |
| **Adopt** | Incrementally implement the strategy across functional areas. |
| **Govern** | Track and measure the success of your deployment. |
| **Manage** | Use monitoring and detection technologies. Incrementally mature each functional area. |

### How it differs from the Cloud Adoption Framework

The Cloud Adoption Framework focuses on introducing new apps and services into an organization, with a repeatable process for each workload added to the digital estate. Zero Trust adoption requires a different scope: introducing new security configurations across an entire digital estate.

The scale motion for Zero Trust is two-dimensional:

1. Take a piece of the Zero Trust architecture, such as data protection, and scale it across the entire digital estate.
2. Repeat the process with each additional piece of the Zero Trust architecture, starting with strategic quick wins and foundational elements, then advancing to more complex areas.

The Zero Trust adoption framework recommends building a strategy through business scenarios, including:

- Rapidly modernize your security posture.
- Secure remote and hybrid work.
- Identify and protect sensitive business data.
- Prevent or reduce business damage from a breach.
- Meet regulatory and compliance requirements.

## Zero Trust Rapid Modernization Plan

The Zero Trust Rapid Modernization Plan (RaMP) provides a set of deployment paths to quickly implement key layers of protection. RaMP takes a project management and checklist approach. It provides a suggested mapping of key stakeholders, implementers, and their accountabilities, along with checklists of deployment objectives and implementation steps.

Zero Trust is a major transformation, so it's critical to start with the most impactful items that deliver the most security and productivity gains with the least investment of time and resources.

The Zero Trust RaMP is included in the Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architectures (MCRA) and aligns to these recommended security modernization initiatives:

- **Secure identities and access:** Focus on using cloud-based security capabilities to rapidly modernize access control and increase both productivity and security assurances.
- **Data security and governance, risk, compliance (GRC):** Focus on ensuring the organization can rapidly recover from a ransomware or extortion attack without paying attackers, and protect the most valuable business-critical data.
- **Modern security operations:** Focus on streamlining responses to common attacks, getting end-to-end visibility across the enterprise, and automating manual tasks that slow down analysts.
- **Infrastructure and development security:** Focus on security hygiene, reducing legacy risk, integrating security into DevOps and development processes, and applying microsegmentation concepts.
- **Operational technology (OT) and Internet of Things (IoT) security:** Focus on quickly discovering, protecting, and monitoring these systems for attacks.

Together, the adoption framework and RaMP give you both the strategic planning structure and the tactical quick wins needed to make progress on your Zero Trust journey.

In this module, you learned how to design comprehensive endpoint security solutions across diverse environments.

You learned how to:

- Specify security requirements for servers, including Windows and Linux across Azure, on-premises, and multicloud environments
- Specify security requirements for mobile devices and clients, including endpoint protection, hardening, and configuration
- Specify security requirements for IoT devices and embedded systems
- Evaluate solutions for securing operational technology (OT) and industrial control systems (ICS)
- Specify security baselines for server and client endpoints
- Design a solution for secure remote access to virtual machines in Azure landing zones
- Evaluate Windows Local Administrator Password Solution (Windows LAPS)

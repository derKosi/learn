Endpoints represent one of the most common attack surfaces in any organization. As a security architect, you must design comprehensive security strategies that protect servers, clients, mobile devices, IoT systems, and operational technology across diverse environments.

Imagine you're designing security requirements for an organization with Windows and Linux servers in Azure and on-premises, mobile devices used by a distributed workforce, IoT sensors in manufacturing facilities, and operational technology controlling critical infrastructure. Each endpoint type has unique security considerations, and your architecture must address them all while maintaining a consistent security posture.

This module focuses on the security architect's role in specifying requirements and evaluating solutions for endpoint protection. You learn how to apply Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB) controls, select appropriate Microsoft Defender solutions, and design secure architectures for different endpoint scenarios.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you're able to:

- Specify security requirements for servers, including Windows and Linux across Azure, on-premises, and multicloud environments
- Specify security requirements for mobile devices and clients, including endpoint protection, hardening, and configuration
- Specify security requirements for IoT devices and embedded systems
- Evaluate solutions for securing operational technology (OT) and industrial control systems (ICS) by using Microsoft Defender for IoT
- Specify security baselines for server and client endpoints
- Design a solution for secure remote access to virtual machines in Azure landing zones
- Evaluate Windows Local Administrator Password Solution (Windows LAPS)

## Prerequisites

- Advanced experience and knowledge in identity and access, platform protection, security operations, securing data, and securing applications
- Experience with hybrid and cloud implementations
- Familiarity with Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

The content in this module helps you prepare for the SC-100: Microsoft Cybersecurity Architect certification exam.

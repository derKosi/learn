Identity is the primary security perimeter in cloud and hybrid environments. As a cybersecurity architect, you're responsible for designing identity and access management solutions that verify every user and workload, control access to resources, and protect against identity-based attacks.

## Scenario

Your organization is expanding its cloud footprint across Azure, AWS, and GCP while maintaining on-premises Active Directory infrastructure. The security team needs an identity architecture that:

- Controls access to SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS resources through identity, networking, and application controls
- Extends Microsoft Entra ID across hybrid and multicloud environments
- Enables secure collaboration with external partners and customers
- Implements modern authentication strategies that adapt to risk
- Enforces Zero Trust principles through Conditional Access policies
- Hardens Active Directory Domain Services against credential-based attacks
- Centrally manages secrets, keys, and certificates

As the cybersecurity architect, you design the identity and access management solutions that balance security with productivity across this complex environment.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you're able to:

- Design access strategies for SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, hybrid, and multicloud resources using identity, networking, and application controls
- Design a solution for Microsoft Entra ID, including hybrid and multicloud environments
- Design a solution for external identities, including B2B collaboration and customer identity
- Design modern authentication and authorization strategies
- Validate Conditional Access alignment with Zero Trust
- Specify requirements for securing Active Directory Domain Services
- Design a solution for managing secrets, keys, and certificates

## Prerequisites

- Advanced experience with identity and access concepts including authentication, authorization, and Active Directory
- Experience with Microsoft Entra ID, Conditional Access, and Azure Key Vault
- Conceptual knowledge of Zero Trust security principles

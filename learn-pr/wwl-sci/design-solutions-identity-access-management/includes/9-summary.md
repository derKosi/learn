In this module, you learned how to design identity and access management solutions that protect organizational resources across cloud, hybrid, and multicloud environments.

You learned how to:

- Design access strategies for SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, hybrid, and multicloud resources using identity, networking, and application controls
- Design a solution for Microsoft Entra ID, including hybrid and multicloud environments
- Design a solution for external identities, including B2B collaboration and customer identity
- Design modern authentication and authorization strategies
- Validate Conditional Access alignment with Zero Trust
- Specify requirements for securing Active Directory Domain Services
- Design a solution for managing secrets, keys, and certificates

## Key takeaways

- **Consolidate identity on Microsoft Entra ID** as the central identity provider across all environments, including AWS and GCP, to simplify governance and enable consistent access policies.
- **Choose Cloud Sync for new hybrid deployments** and password hash synchronization as the default authentication method for the strongest security features and resiliency.
- **Apply Zero Trust across all identity decisions** — verify explicitly with Conditional Access, enforce least privilege with PIM and access reviews, and assume breach with continuous monitoring.
- **Protect secrets with Azure Key Vault** using RBAC, managed identities, and automated rotation to eliminate hardcoded credentials.
- **Harden AD DS with tiered administration** and integrate sign-in signals with Microsoft Sentinel for centralized threat detection across hybrid and multicloud environments.

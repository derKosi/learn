In this module, you learned how to evaluate and design security solutions for Microsoft 365 productivity and collaboration workloads. You explored the tools, services, and design decisions that a security architect uses to protect email, collaboration, devices, data, and AI interactions across an organization.

You're now able to:

- **Evaluate security posture** for productivity and collaboration workloads by using Microsoft Secure Score and Microsoft Security Exposure Management. You learned how to interpret score metrics, prioritize recommended actions, and extend posture evaluation through vulnerability management integration, data connectors, and AI readiness assessments.
- **Design a Microsoft Defender XDR solution** that covers Microsoft Defender for Office 365 (Plan 1 and Plan 2) and Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps. You evaluated how Safe Attachments, Safe Links, anti-phishing policies, and automated investigation and response protect email and collaboration workloads. You also assessed how Defender for Cloud Apps provides shadow IT discovery, SaaS security posture management, and AI-specific threat protection.
- **Design device management configurations and security policies** by using Microsoft Intune. You evaluated app protection policies, device compliance policies, Conditional Access integration, and endpoint security policies as layered controls that protect corporate data on both managed and unmanaged devices.
- **Evaluate solutions for securing data in Microsoft 365** by using Microsoft Purview. You assessed data classification with sensitive information types, trainable classifiers, and exact data match. You evaluated sensitivity labels, data loss prevention across six Microsoft 365 locations, encryption key management with Double Key Encryption and Customer Key, Information Barriers, and Data Security Posture Management.
- **Evaluate data security and compliance controls for Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365.** You learned how Copilot's permission-based data access model amplifies oversharing risks, and how Data Security Posture Management for AI, sensitivity labels, DLP, Insider Risk Management, auditing, eDiscovery, retention, and communication compliance extend to Copilot interactions.

Without these solutions, the financial services organization in the example scenario would lack the visibility, policy enforcement, and threat protection needed to secure sensitive data across its Microsoft 365 environment—especially as generative AI tools expand the attack surface.

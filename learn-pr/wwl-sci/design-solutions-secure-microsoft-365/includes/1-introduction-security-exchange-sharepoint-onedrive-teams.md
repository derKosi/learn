Microsoft 365 is at the center of most organizations' productivity and collaboration strategy. Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams handle sensitive communications, business-critical documents, and day-to-day collaboration across departments. As a security architect, you need to design security solutions that protect these workloads without disrupting the productivity they enable.

Securing Microsoft 365 involves multiple layers. You need to measure your current posture with quantitative metrics, protect email, and cloud apps against evolving threats, manage device access to corporate data, classify and protect sensitive information, and address the new risks that generative AI tools introduce. Each of these layers requires different Microsoft security services, and your job is to evaluate which capabilities to deploy and how they work together for your organization.

## Example scenario

Suppose you're the lead security architect for a financial services company with 15,000 employees. Your organization uses Microsoft 365 E5 across all workloads and recently deployed Microsoft 365 Copilot to several business units. Leadership wants assurance that sensitive financial data is protected and that the introduction of AI tools doesn't expand the organization's attack surface. You need to evaluate which Microsoft security capabilities to enable, how to measure their effectiveness, and how to design policies that protect data across email, collaboration, devices, and AI interactions.

This module walks you through the evaluation and design decisions you'd make in this scenario.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you're able to:

- Evaluate security posture for productivity and collaboration workloads by using Microsoft Secure Score and Microsoft Security Exposure Management.
- Design a Microsoft Defender XDR solution that covers Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, including AI-specific threat protection.
- Design device management configurations and security policies by using Microsoft Intune.
- Evaluate solutions for securing data in Microsoft 365 by using Microsoft Purview data classification, sensitivity labels, data loss prevention, and encryption key management.
- Evaluate data security and compliance controls in Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 services, including Data Security Posture Management for AI.

## Prerequisites

- Advanced experience and knowledge in identity and access, platform protection, security operations, securing data, and securing applications.
- Experience with hybrid and cloud implementations.
- Familiarity with Microsoft 365 services, including Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams.

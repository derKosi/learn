As organizations adopt hybrid and multicloud architectures, the network perimeter extends well beyond a single data center or virtual network. A security architect must evaluate network designs against Zero Trust principles, segment workloads to limit lateral movement, filter traffic at multiple layers, monitor for threats in real time, and secure access for both internet-bound and private traffic.

Imagine you're a cybersecurity architect at a large enterprise that operates across Azure, on-premises data centers, and multiple SaaS services. Leadership asks you to review the current network security posture and recommend improvements. You need to evaluate whether the existing segmentation strategy limits blast radius, determine whether traffic filtering rules follow least-privilege principles, assess monitoring coverage for blind spots, and decide how Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Private Access can replace legacy VPN and proxy infrastructure. Each decision affects the organization's ability to detect and contain threats before they spread.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you learn how to:

- Evaluate network designs to align with security requirements and best practices
- Design solutions for network segmentation
- Design solutions for filtering traffic with network security groups
- Design solutions for network posture management
- Design solutions for network monitoring
- Evaluate solutions that use Microsoft Entra Internet Access
- Evaluate solutions that use Microsoft Entra Private Access

The content in this module helps you prepare for the certification exam SC-100: Microsoft Cybersecurity Architect.

## Prerequisites

- Advanced experience and knowledge in identity and access, platform protection, security operations, securing data, and securing applications.

Organizations store and share sensitive data across cloud services, collaboration platforms, and on-premises environments. As data moves across multiple systems, security teams face challenges in ensuring proper classification, protection, and policy enforcement. To address these challenges, organizations need visibility into where sensitive data resides, how it's labeled, and how it's accessed. Without it, they struggle to enforce security policies, increasing the risk of data leaks, compliance violations, and unauthorized access.

Microsoft Purview provides tools that help security and compliance teams track classified data, enforce protection policies, and detect potential risks. Information Protection Reports, Data explorer, Content explorer, and Activity explorer provide real-time insights into data security, enabling organizations to monitor labeling adoption, investigate policy effectiveness, and analyze user activity trends.

By using these tools, organizations can:

- Track data classification and protection across Microsoft 365, Azure, AWS, and on-premises sources
- Identify labeling gaps and verify that sensitive information is properly secured
- Review user activity to detect unauthorized access or policy violations
- Apply AI-driven insights with Microsoft Security Copilot, including its embedded experience in Microsoft Purview, to summarize alerts and surface next steps

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Assess classification and protection trends with Information Protection Reports
- Examine labeled content with Data explorer and Content explorer
- Review user activity in Activity explorer to identify policy violations
- Use Microsoft Security Copilot (embedded in Purview) to summarize DLP and insider-risk alerts

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- A basic understanding of Microsoft Purview and its role in data security and compliance
- Experience assigning sensitivity labels and data loss prevention (DLP) policies in Microsoft 365

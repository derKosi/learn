Copilot in Teams is an AI-powered meeting assistant designed to help you focus on conversation instead of documentation.  
During a Teams meeting, Copilot uses the meeting transcript, chat, and contextual signals to identify key themes, decisions, and action items—then summarizes them in clear, natural language.  

For HR professionals, this means less manual typing and more meaningful engagement with candidates.  
Instead of scrambling to capture every response, you can concentrate on evaluating soft skills, tone, and culture fit while Copilot tracks what’s is being said and who said it.

Copilot integrates directly into the Teams meeting window. Once transcription is enabled, you can open Copilot through the **meeting toolbar** to start asking real-time questions such as:

- “Summarize the candidate’s response about leadership experience.”  
- “Highlight areas where the candidate’s experience aligns with our job description.”  
- “List follow-up questions suggested by the panel.”
 
## Requirements
To use Copilot in Microsoft Teams meetings, you need:

- A Microsoft 365 subscription with Copilot access (such as Microsoft 365 E3/E5 with Copilot add-on).
- Transcription enabled in Teams.
- Admin permissions to manage meeting settings.

## How Copilot works behind the scenes  

Copilot in Teams uses large language models to analyze meeting data securely within your organization’s Microsoft 365 tenant. It doesn’t share content externally or stores it outside of your organization’s compliance boundaries.  

When you enable transcription, Copilot can interpret context such as who’s speaking, which topics are discussed, and how ideas relate to your organization’s documents—like a candidate résumé stored in OneDrive or questions shared in Outlook.  

After the meeting, Copilot organizes this data into structured summaries accessible through the meeting chat or the **Recap** tab. 
 
You can continue interacting with Copilot afterward by prompting it with questions or requests like:

- “Summarize key takeaways from this interview.”  
- “Create a feedback summary comparing communication skills across candidates.”  
- “Generate a list of follow-up actions discussed by the panel.”

This workflow ensures your hiring team walks away with accurate, shareable notes that reflect the entire conversation—not just what someone managed to type manually.

## Why use Copilot during the interview process  

The traditional interview process often relies on scattered notes or individual impressions. Copilot helps standardize and streamline that process.  

| Challenge | How Copilot helps |
|:---|:---|
| Missed details or incomplete notes | Captures every spoken point through live transcription and AI summarization. |
| Disorganized feedback | Creates structured summaries that highlight themes, skills, and decisions. |
| Limited focus on candidates | Frees interviewers from note-taking, enabling active listening and engagement. |
| Inconsistent evaluations | Provides consistent summaries that reduce bias and improve fairness. |
| Time-consuming follow-ups | Generates post-meeting reports instantly, saving hours of manual work. |

## Key features that support HR interviews  

Copilot offers several intelligent capabilities that make interview management more efficient:

- **Real-time comprehension:** Summarizes what’s being discussed as it happens, identifying relevant insights or next steps.  
- **Catch-up summaries:** When someone joins late, Copilot can provide a concise recap of what’s already been covered.  
- **Contextual follow-ups:** You can prompt Copilot to dig deeper—“Show me where the candidate discussed teamwork” or “Summarize disagreements.”  
- **Post-meeting continuity:** Copilot stays available after the session, letting you refine summaries or export insights to Word or Excel.  
- **Integration with Microsoft 365 apps:** Meeting recaps and notes connect seamlessly with Outlook, SharePoint, and Teams channels for easy sharing and review.

> Copilot responses are generated from your meeting’s transcript and chat and remain within your tenant boundary.

## Best practices for using Copilot in interviews  

To get the most out of Copilot during a candidate interview, consider these best practices:

1. **Enable transcription before the meeting begins.** Copilot relies on transcription to generate summaries accurately.  
2. **Inform participants.** Let candidates know that the meeting is being transcribed and summarized by Copilot.  
3. **Use intentional prompts.** Be specific with your Copilot questions—ask for summaries about leadership, teamwork, or problem-solving to focus the output.  
4. **Review and refine.** After the meeting, verify Copilot’s summary for accuracy before sharing it with stakeholders.  
5. **Store results securely.** Save feedback and summaries in SharePoint or a dedicated HR folder to maintain compliance and confidentiality.

## The value of Copilot for HR decision-making  

Copilot transforms raw conversation into usable data that helps HR professionals make faster, more confident decisions.  

By automatically summarizing discussions, identifying themes, and surfacing insights, Copilot gives teams the ability to:

- Compare candidate responses more objectively.  
- Track recurring strengths or skill gaps across multiple interviews.  
- Support evidence-based hiring decisions with documented insights.  

Ultimately, Copilot helps interviewers spend less time on logistics and more time evaluating potential—enhancing both the efficiency and fairness of the hiring process.

## Conduct the interview using Copilot

1.  Start the meeting—**transcription begins automatically** if it was enabled when the meeting was scheduled.
 
> [!NOTE]
> Transcription will **not** start automatically unless it was turned on in the meeting options when the event was scheduled.  
> You can still manually start transcription once the meeting begins by selecting **More (⋯)** and **Start transcription** from the meeting toolbar.
> :::image type="content" border="true" source="../media/meeting-session-more.png" alt-text="Screenshots showing meeting options durning a live Teams meeting":::

1. Select the **Copilot** icon on the meeting toolbar.  
1. Use prompts such as:  
   - “Summarize the candidate’s response to the teamwork question.”  
   - “Highlight strengths and areas for improvement.”  
   - “List next steps discussed by the panel.”

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="../media/meeting-copilot.png" alt-text="Screenshots showing the copilot options durning a live Teams meeting":::
 
1. Keep the conversation natural—Copilot captures themes and action items automatically.  
1. If someone joins late, use **Copilot Catch-up** to review what’s already been discussed.

> [!TIP]
> You can ask Copilot to compare responses or summarize recurring themes in real time.  
> Example: *“Compare the candidate’s leadership examples with our job description requirements.”*

## Review and summarize after the meeting

1. After the meeting ends, open the **Recap** tab in the meeting chat.
  
1. Select the **Copilot** icon to continue interacting with the meeting content.  
1. Ask Copilot:  
   - “Summarize the candidate’s communication style.”  
   - “Generate a short feedback report for the hiring manager.”  

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="../media/recap.png" alt-text="Screenshots showing the recap options durning a after a Teams meeting":::
 
1. Review the generated notes and insights from Copilot.  
1. Save your feedback to your HR SharePoint or OneDrive folder.

## Reflect and discuss

Consider the following reflection questions:

- How did using Copilot change your focus during the interview?  
- What insights or details did it capture that you might have missed manually?  
- How could this workflow help your team maintain consistent, unbiased evaluations?

By integrating Microsoft Teams and Copilot, HR professionals can spend less time on logistics and more time connecting with candidates—improving both efficiency and hiring outcomes.

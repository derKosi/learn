A Microsoft Teams interview space is a secure, digital meeting environment designed to bring candidates and interviewers together in real time—no matter where they are. It combines scheduling, communication, file sharing, and collaboration in a single workspace, reducing the friction of coordinating across multiple tools.

Depending on the format, this space can be set up as a **Meeting** for interactive discussions or a **Webinar** for structured sessions with multiple presenters and audience controls.

A well-structured interview space in Teams is:

- **Purpose-built:** It provides everything needed to host, record, and manage the interview in one place.  
- **Centralized:** Meeting invites, chat threads, and shared documents are all stored within the same context.  
- **Configurable:** Organizers can choose between a standard **Meeting** or a **Webinar**, depending on the interview format and number of participants.  
- **Secure:** Access settings and lobby controls ensure that only approved participants can join the call.  
- **Persistent:** Files, chats, and notes remain available after the meeting, creating a transparent record for future review.  

> [!NOTE]  
> When scheduling an interview in Teams, organizers can choose between a **Meeting**—ideal for one-on-one or small-panel interviews—and a **Webinar**, which supports structured sessions with registration, multiple presenters, and audience controls.

## Why setting up the interview space matters  

The way an interview is set up directly affects candidate experience, interviewer focus, and overall efficiency.  
A disorganized approach—such as separate email threads for scheduling, unclear meeting links, or missing documents—can cause delays and confusion.  
Teams solves these challenges by consolidating every element of the interview into a unified, accessible hub.

When the interview space is configured properly, HR teams can:

- **Create clarity for candidates.** All interview details, including the meeting link, agenda, and relevant documents, are shared in one invitation.  
- **Coordinate panels effortlessly.** Interviewers can review materials, leave private comments, and prepare questions before the call.  
- **Maintain consistency.** Each candidate experiences the same professional setup and clear communication.  
- **Minimize technical issues.** Built-in Teams features—such as device checks, lobby control, and chat—reduce last-minute friction.  

## Core components of a Teams interview space  

While every interview may differ slightly, most Teams-based sessions share the same foundational components.

| Component | Purpose | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Meeting or webinar type | Defines how participants interact (interactive vs. structured). | A one-on-one meeting for a technical screen vs. a webinar for a panel presentation. |
| Organizer and presenters | Control meeting options and manage the flow. | Recruiter as organizer; hiring manager as copresenter. |
| Participants | Attendees such as the candidate or HR observers. | Candidate plus panel members. |
| Agenda and materials | Provide structure and reference documents. | Résumé, job description, interview questions. |
| Permissions and privacy | Ensure only authorized users can join or access files. | Lobby enabled; recording restricted to organizer. |
| Follow-up resources | Support documentation and feedback collection after the meeting. | Meeting recording, shared notes, and Copilot summary. |

## How Teams supports HR interviews  

Teams is more than a video call—it’s a connected workspace that simplifies every stage of the interview process.  

- **Before the interview:** Use the Teams calendar to schedule meetings, add attendees, and upload materials so everyone arrives prepared.  
- **During the interview:** Teams provides tools like chat, reactions, and shared notes to enhance communication.  
- **After the interview:** Chats, files, and recordings remain available in the same thread, creating a record that can be reviewed and referenced later.

> In Windows 11, you can use **Snap Layouts** to organize Teams, Outlook, and résumé documents side by side, making it easier to multitask and stay focused during the interview.  

## The benefits of using Teams for interviews  

By standardizing interview setup through Teams, organizations gain tangible benefits:  

- **Consistency:** Every candidate has the same high-quality experience, no matter who hosts the session.  
- **Efficiency:** Scheduling, communication, and documentation happen in one tool instead of many.  
- **Transparency:** Shared files and notes are visible to authorized team members, reducing miscommunication.  
- **Professionalism:** Branded backgrounds, lobby settings, and controlled access create a polished experience that reflects your organization’s values.  
- **Integration:** Because Teams is part of Microsoft 365, it connects seamlessly with Outlook, SharePoint, and Copilot to support end-to-end HR workflows.

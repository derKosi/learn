Human Resources professionals are responsible for more than filling open roles. They guide the full employee journey—from recruiting and onboarding to performance management and development. In today’s hybrid workplace, these responsibilities often stretch across different locations, time zones, and technologies.  

Imagine you’re preparing to interview a candidate for a critical role on your team. You need to coordinate schedules, share the résumé with other interviewers, and ensure everyone has access to the same materials. During the meeting, you want to focus on the conversation, not on taking notes. Afterward, you need a concise summary that captures the candidate’s strengths and next steps. Managing all of this manually—through email threads, separate notes, and multiple document versions—can quickly become confusing and time-consuming.  

Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365 Copilot can help with this process by bringing collaboration, communication, and documentation into one place. Teams provides the meeting environment where you can schedule interviews, organize materials, and connect with candidates face-to-face. Copilot acts as your intelligent meeting assistant, capturing discussion points, summarizing insights, and generating actionable follow-up items. Together, they help HR professionals stay organized, save time, and make data-informed hiring decisions.  

By the end of this module, you know how to use Teams and Copilot to prepare, conduct, and document candidate interviews efficiently—all within your Microsoft 365 environment.

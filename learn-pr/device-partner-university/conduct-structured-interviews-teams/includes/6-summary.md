Your organization is growing, and the hiring team needs to fill several key roles quickly. Each recruiter is managing multiple interviews across different departments and time zones. In the past, this process required juggling emails, handwritten notes, and multiple document versions just to capture feedback and schedule follow-ups. Critical insights were sometimes lost, and interview summaries varied from one interviewer to another.

In this module, you learned how Microsoft Teams and Copilot streamline the interview processâ€”helping HR professionals schedule meetings, capture insights, and generate summaries in one secure workspace. By reducing administrative overhead and improving consistency, these tools empower you to focus on evaluating candidates and making confident, data-informed hiring decisions.

Microsoft 365 apps are governed by the Modern Lifecycle Policy, which ensures that customers remain protected and up to date through regular servicing and system requirements.

To stay supported, all of the following conditions must be met:

- The product or service remains under active support from Microsoft.
- The customer installs updates and upgrades as they're released.
- The system meets the minimum servicing and hardware requirements.
- The customer maintains a valid license for the product or service.

Because Windows 10 has reached end of support, devices still running it no longer meet the full support criteria for Microsoft 365 apps. While apps will continue to receive security updates, they're considered out of full support.

## Why the lifecycle matters

Microsoft 365 apps are updated frequently. These updates not only add new features but also deliver crucial compatibility fixes and security patches. Once an operating system is out of support, Microsoft can no longer guarantee that these updates will install correctly or function as intended.

In short, lifecycle alignment ensures that Microsoft 365 apps are tested, validated, and supported in their intended environment.

## What it means to "stay current"

To remain compliant with the Modern Lifecycle Policy, organizations should:

- Install updates and upgrades as they're released.
- Maintain systems that meet the published hardware and servicing requirements.
- Adopt changes in a timely manner to avoid support interruptions.

>[!TIP]
> Microsoft recommends enabling automatic updates for both Windows and Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise to simplify compliance with lifecycle requirements.

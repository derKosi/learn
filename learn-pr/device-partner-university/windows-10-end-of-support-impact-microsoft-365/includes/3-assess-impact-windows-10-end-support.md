Windows 10 end of support affects how Microsoft 365 apps behave, receive updates, and qualify for technical assistance.

## What still works (and what changes)

Although Microsoft 365 apps will still run on Windows 10 for a limited time, their behavior and support status have changed significantly. The following table summarizes key areas affected by the end of support.

| **Area** | **Behavior after October 14, 2025** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **App access** | Apps like Word, Excel, and Outlook continue to work with an active Microsoft 365 subscription. |
| **Feature updates** | Feature updates will continue until late 2026 or early 2027 depending on update channel. After that, apps will remain on Version 2608. |
| **Security updates** | Updates continue through **October 10, 2028**, after which they end permanently. |
| **Technical support** | Limited troubleshooting assistance only. Issues unique to Windows 10 may require reproducing on Windows 11. |
| **Bug reports and feedback** | New bug submissions or feature requests won't be accepted for Windows 10 environments. |

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft 365 apps running on Windows 10 will receive security updates until October 10, 2028, regardless of whether ESUs are applied to Windows 10. After that date, no further updates or fixes will be provided.
> Microsoft 365 apps on Windows 10 will receive feature updates until:
> August 2026 for Current Channel
> October 13, 2026 for Monthly Enterprise Channel
> January 12, 2027 for Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel
> After these dates, apps will remain on Version 2608 and receive only security updates until October 10, 2028.

## Extended Security Updates (ESUs)

Extended Security Updates (ESUs) for Windows 10 offer critical security patches beyond the official end-of-support date, helping organizations reduce risk while transitioning to newer systems. However, ESUs don't extend the full support lifecycle—they only cover essential security fixes, not feature updates or technical support.

Even with ESUs applied, Microsoft 365 apps on Windows 10 aren't fully supported. They receive security updates but lack full feature support, bug reporting, and technical assistance. This means organizations might face compliance issues, reduced functionality, and lack of access to new Microsoft 365 innovations.

Think of ESUs as a temporary safety net, not a long-term solution. They're designed to buy time for migration—not to maintain parity with Windows 11 environments, which continue to receive full support, feature updates, and AI-driven enhancements.

## Why upgrade to Windows 11

Running Microsoft 365 on a supported operating system provides several advantages beyond compliance.

| **Area** | **Benefit of Windows 11** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Security** | Hardware-based isolation, TPM 2.0, and virtualization-based protection help safeguard Microsoft 365 data. |
| **Performance** | Optimized for modern hardware and APIs, delivering better reliability and responsiveness. |
| **Access to new features** | Capabilities like Snap Layouts and Snap Groups require Windows 11. |
| **Ongoing support** | Regular feature, quality, and security updates for both operating system and apps. |

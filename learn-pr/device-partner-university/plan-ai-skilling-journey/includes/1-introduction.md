Imagine your company just announced a new AI initiative. Leadership is excited, employees are curious, and expectations are high—but no one’s sure what "getting skilled in AI" really means. Some teams dive into tools like Copilot, while others hesitate, unsure how AI fits into their work.

That uncertainty is common. Successfully integrating AI requires both structure and intention. This module is designed for learning leaders, HR partners, and managers who guide organizational learning. An AI skilling journey provides the framework to turn curiosity into capability—connecting individual exploration with measurable business outcomes.  

Throughout this module, you’ll learn how to design that journey step by step: assessing your organization’s readiness, creating role-based skilling plans, and fostering a culture where AI learning continues to grow.

## Learning objectives

- Assess your organization's AI readiness to identify current strengths, gaps, and opportunities for growth.
- Design structured skilling journeys that align AI learning with day-to-day work and business outcomes using Microsoft Copilot 365 in Microsoft Word.

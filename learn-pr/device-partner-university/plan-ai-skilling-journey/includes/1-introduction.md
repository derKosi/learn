# Introduction

Imagine your company just announced a new AI initiative. Leadership is excited, employees are curious, and expectations are high — but no one knows exactly what "getting skilled in AI" means. Some teams jump into tools like Copilot, while others hesitate, unsure of how AI fits their work.

That uncertainty is common. Integrating AI effectively requires structure and intention. This module is for learning leaders, HR partners, or managers responsible for AI skilling. An AI skilling journey gives your organization both — a way to connect individual curiosity with business outcomes. Throughout this module, you'll explore how to design that journey step by step: understanding where you are today, defining role-based skilling journeys, and building a culture where AI learning never stops.

## Learning objectives

- Assess your organization's AI readiness to identify current strengths, gaps, and opportunities for growth.
- Design structured, role-based skilling journeys that align AI learning with day-to-day work and business outcomes.
- Build and sustain a culture of responsible, collaborative AI use by integrating ongoing learning and Microsoft's Responsible AI principles.

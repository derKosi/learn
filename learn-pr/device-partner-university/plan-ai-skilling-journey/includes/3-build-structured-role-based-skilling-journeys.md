Once you know where your organization sits on the AI readiness spectrum, the next step is to guide employees forward with clear, role-based skilling journeys. A one-size-fits-all course rarely sticks; relevance and progression are what turn curiosity into capability.

Each stage of readiness calls for a different approach:

| **Readiness level** | **Focus** | **Example actions** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Explore** | Build curiosity and AI literacy. Help employees understand what AI is and how it shows up in their daily tools. | Encourage teams to experiment with Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word, Excel, or Outlook to summarize, draft, or analyze. Host brief "AI in action" demos or show-and-tell sessions. |
| **Build** | Integrate role-based learning into daily work. Move from awareness to hands-on use that supports productivity and collaboration. | Partner with department leads to identify 3–5 Copilot scenarios per role—such as summarizing client notes, rewriting communications, or analyzing data trends. Collect feedback on what feels most useful. |
| **Optimize** | Embed continuous learning and responsible AI practices. Share success stories and measure impact. | Establish "Copilot Champions" who mentor peers, update best practices quarterly, and track improvements in efficiency, satisfaction, or data literacy. |

By designing skilling journeys that evolve with organizational maturity, you make AI skilling both structured and scalable—meeting learners where they are while building momentum toward an AI-confident culture.

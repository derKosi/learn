Once you know where your organization sits on the AI readiness spectrum, the next step is to guide employees forward with clear, role-based skilling journeys. A one-size-fits-all course rarely sticks; relevance and progression are what turn curiosity into capability.

To make learning meaningful, connect AI skills to what people actually do in their roles. Start by identifying the core tasks, decisions, and tools each role depends on. Then map how AI—especially Microsoft 365 Copilot—can streamline, enhance, or reimagine those workflows. For example, sales teams might focus on summarizing client notes or drafting proposals, while HR could explore how AI supports onboarding or policy updates. This approach keeps training grounded in daily work, making it easier for employees to see tangible value and build confidence.

Each stage of readiness calls for a different approach:

| **Readiness level** | **Focus** | **Example actions** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Explore** | Build curiosity and AI literacy. Help employees understand what AI is and how it shows up in their daily tools. | Encourage teams to experiment with Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word, Excel, or Outlook to summarize, draft, or analyze. Host brief "AI in action" demos or show-and-tell sessions. |
| **Build** | Integrate role-based learning into daily work. Move from awareness to hands-on use that supports productivity and collaboration. | Partner with department leads to identify 3–5 Copilot scenarios per role—such as summarizing client notes, rewriting communications, or analyzing data trends. Collect feedback on what feels most useful. |
| **Optimize** | Embed continuous learning and responsible AI practices. Share success stories and measure impact. | Establish "Copilot Champions" who mentor peers, update best practices quarterly, and track improvements in efficiency, satisfaction, or data literacy. |

By designing skilling journeys that evolve with organizational maturity, you make AI skilling both structured and scalable—meeting learners where they are while building momentum toward an AI-confident culture.


## Mini-exercise: Identify AI opportunities by role

Take a few minutes to brainstorm how AI could support your own team’s work.

1. List three roles within your organization (for example, Sales, HR, or Finance).  
2. For each role, identify one daily task that could be made easier or more impactful with Microsoft 365 Copilot.  
3. Consider how those examples could fit into your organization’s current AI readiness stage.

>[!TIP]
> You can use Microsoft Copilot to expand on these ideas. Try prompting it with: "Suggest three role-based AI learning priorities for [department or role], aligned with the [Explore / Build / Optimize] stage."

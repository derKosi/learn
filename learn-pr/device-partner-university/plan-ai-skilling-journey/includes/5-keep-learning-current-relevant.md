AI evolves fast—and so should your training. Even the best-designed programs lose impact if they stagnate. How you maintain and update learning depends on where your organization is in its AI journey:

| **Readiness level** | **Recommended approach** | **Typical actions** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Explore** | Begin developing simple habits for review. | Schedule periodic check-ins, even if formal training doesn't yet exist. Capture and share "quick wins" from early adopters. Note emerging AI topics that generate interest or confusion. |
| **Build** | Establish a predictable rhythm for updates. | Refresh materials quarterly or twice a year. Assign an owner or small working group to monitor AI advancements. Update examples, links, and internal guidance to reflect new tools. |
| **Optimize** | Embed continuous improvement into operations. | Treat AI learning updates as part of standard release or performance cycles. Track participation and outcomes as business metrics. Use feedback and analytics to refine skilling goals continuously. |

No matter the stage, feedback loops keep your learning program healthy. Ask employees what resonates, what confuses them, and where they need more depth. Use short surveys, focus groups, or quick Teams polls to gather insight. Adjust content accordingly, and communicate updates so learners see that you're listening.

## Quick self-reflection: Updating your AI skilling program

Ask these questions each time you review your AI learning content:

- Are our current learning goals still aligned with business priorities and AI strategy?
- Have any new tools, features, or use cases made parts of our training outdated?
- Which sections of our learning content are most and least engaging for employees—and why?
- Do employees have opportunities to apply what they've learned in real work scenarios?
- How do we currently collect learner feedback, and is that process consistent?
- Have we incorporated recent examples of AI success stories or lessons learned internally?
- Are Responsible AI and data-privacy practices clearly represented in our materials?
- Who is accountable for keeping AI training current, and how often do they review it?

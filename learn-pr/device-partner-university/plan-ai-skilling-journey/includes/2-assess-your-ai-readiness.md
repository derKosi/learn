Before building any training, take a clear-eyed look at your starting point. Assessing readiness helps you identify both opportunities and obstacles.

Start by mapping your team's existing comfort with AI. Who already experiments with it in daily tasks? Who's hesitant or skeptical? These insights help you focus your efforts and tailor communication to different levels of confidence.

Equally important is your organization's *attitude* toward learning. People need space — and permission — to explore AI without fear of mistakes. Encourage leaders to model curiosity, schedule time for experimentation, and celebrate early attempts, even when they're imperfect. This builds trust and lowers barriers to engagement.

## Stages of AI capability

Organizations typically progress through several stages as they build AI capability. Use the table to understand what each stage looks like and to identify where your organization might be today.

| **Level** | **Description** | **Typical characteristics** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Explore** | Curiosity without coordination | • AI experimentation is ad-hoc and individual.<br>• No formal training or policy in place.<br>• Leadership interest is emerging but undefined. |
| **Build** | Early structure and growing leadership support | • Leadership recognizes the value of AI learning.<br>• Some training or pilot programs are in place.<br>• Teams begin sharing successes and challenges. |
| **Optimize** | AI skilling embedded in strategy | • Clear alignment between AI initiatives and business goals.<br>• Regular training updates and role-based skilling journeys.<br>• Governance and responsible-use policies established. |

## Gauge your organization's AI starting point

Before you can plan an AI skilling journey, it helps to understand where your organization stands today. Use the brief self-assessment below to take stock of your current level of AI readiness. You don't need to score or share it formally—this is simply a quick way to identify strengths and opportunities.

### Answer the questions

For each statement, answer **Yes** or **No**. Think about your organization as a whole, not your individual experience.

- **Strategy:** Leadership has defined clear goals for using AI.
- **Leadership example:** Managers or executives model curiosity and experimentation with AI tools.
- **Culture:** Employees are encouraged to learn and try AI without fear of mistakes.
- **Skills:** Most employees understand the basics of what AI can and cannot do.
- **Training:** Learning resources for AI are available and promoted internally.
- **Governance:** Guidelines or policies exist that explain how to use AI responsibly.
- **Feedback:** Training programs are reviewed and updated regularly to reflect new technologies.

## Interpret your results

If you answered "Yes" to six or seven questions, your organization is in the **Optimize** stage. AI learning is already embedded in your strategy, and the focus now should be on refining your approach, scaling successful practices, and keeping training current.

If you answered "Yes" to three to five questions, you're in the **Build** stage. Momentum is growing, and the next step is to establish more structure and consistency—creating formal skilling journeys, setting expectations, and ensuring leadership support remains visible.

If you answered "Yes" to two or fewer questions, your organization is in the **Explore** stage. Curiosity and experimentation exist, but coordination is limited. Focus first on building foundational AI understanding and aligning leadership around clear goals for adoption.

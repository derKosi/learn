> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> While Copilot and the Analyst agent are powerful tools for generating insights, summaries, and visualizations, it’s essential to verify all AI-generated information. AI outputs might occasionally be incomplete, inaccurate, or misinterpreted, especially when working with complex financial data. Always cross-check results against source documents, datasets, or manual calculations before making decisions or sharing reports with stakeholders. This ensures data integrity, compliance, and reliable business outcomes.


### 5. Refining the Output
- If needed, refine the insights by providing **additional prompts** or adjusting your queries.

By integrating the Analyst agent into your workflow, you can streamline the data analysis process, gain deeper insights, and enhance your decision-making capabilities.

> [!TIP]
>
>- Be **specific** with your prompts: vague requests often generate incomplete or irrelevant results.
> - **Iterate** on prompts: if the output is unclear, refine your language or break it into smaller steps.
> - **Secure your data**: avoid sharing confidential data in prompts without proper permissions.
> - Use **Snap Layouts** or multiple monitors to compare outputs from different Copilot responses or pass data between platforms.

Many individuals still rely on Windows 10. Now that support has ended, these systems no longer receive security updates or technical assistance—leaving them increasingly vulnerable to modern threats. This module helps you understand what that means and how to make informed upgrade decisions.

Understand the difference: End of Support vs. End of Service

- **End of support (EOS)** marks the final date Microsoft provides updates, security patches, and technical help for Windows 10. After this point, the operating system is no longer maintained.
- **End of service** refers to when specific versions of Windows stop receiving updates. This happens throughout a product lifecycle, but it doesn’t mean the entire OS is unsupported.

Understanding this distinction is key to helping yourself to make informed decisions about upgrading.

It’s easy to misunderstand what "End of Support" really means. Some users assume updates will continue or that there’s no need to act because their device still works. This section clears up those assumptions and explains why moving forward with an upgrade is important for ongoing security and productivity.

Azure subscriptions have a trust relationship with Microsoft Entra ID, which is responsible for authenticating users, services, and devices. Each subscription is linked to a specific tenant ID. There are several ways to [find the tenant ID](/entra/fundamentals/how-to-find-tenant#find-tenant-id-through-the-microsoft-entra-admin-center) associated with your subscription. For guidance on how to [create a new tenant](/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-create-new-tenant#create-a-new-microsoft-entra-tenant), refer to the Microsoft Entra documentation.

Azure subscriptions have a trust relationship with Microsoft Entra ID, which authenticates users, services, and devices. Each subscription is linked to a specific Microsoft Entra tenant, identified by a unique tenant ID. There are several ways to [find the tenant ID](/entra/fundamentals/how-to-find-tenant#find-tenant-id-through-the-microsoft-entra-admin-center) associated with an Azure subscription. For guidance on [how to create a new tenant](/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-create-new-tenant#create-a-new-microsoft-entra-tenant), refer to the Microsoft Entra documentation.

## Helpful definitions

An [Entra tenant](/microsoft-365/education/deploy/intro-azure-active-directory#what-is-a-microsoft-entra-tenant) is a security boundary under an organization’s control. Within this boundary, administrators can manage directory objects (such as users and groups) and configure tenant-wide settings.

A [service principal](/entra/identity-platform/app-objects-and-service-principals?toc=%2Fazure%2Factive-directory%2Fworkload-identities%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fazure%2Factive-directory%2Fworkload-identities%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json&tabs=browser#service-principal-object) represents an application’s identity in a Microsoft Entra tenant. It defines the permissions and access policies the application uses to authenticate and access resources. Service principals are commonly used when apps or automation tools need to securely access Microsoft cloud services without requiring a user to sign in.

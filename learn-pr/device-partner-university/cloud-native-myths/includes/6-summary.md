In this module, you explored cloud-native technology and Windows 11, including what cloud-native means, Windows 11â€™s cloud readiness, and common misconceptions that can affect decision-making. You learned that cloud-native solutions improve efficiency, security, and automation, while Windows 11 supports both traditional and cloud-based management, letting organizations transition at their own pace. We also addressed myths that can slow progress: that a full cloud-native transition is required to deploy Windows 11, that device variation increases total cost of ownership, and that upgrading to Windows 11 risks app incompatibility. By understanding these realities, you can adopt new technologies gradually, retain control over devices and data, and realize the benefits of cloud-native management.

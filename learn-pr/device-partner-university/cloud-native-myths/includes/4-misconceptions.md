When considering a transition to cloud-native solutions or an upgrade to Windows 11 Pro, it’s normal to feel uncertain. You might have heard conflicting information or faced challenges with older IT systems that make new technologies seem more complicated or risky than they really are. These misconceptions can slow progress and create unnecessary concerns. Let’s explore some common myths, why they exist, and uncover what the truth is for you and your organization.

## You must go fully cloud-native to deploy Windows 11 Pro

**Reality**: *You don't need to be fully cloud-native to upgrade to Windows 11 Pro. You can deploy Windows 11 Pro using your existing tools, whether that’s Microsoft Intune, Configuration Manager, or a hybrid approach. This process requires minimal effort for IT admins and has limited impact on employees.*

If your organization uses cloud-native practices already, you’re likely seeing benefits, and you should continue applying them to advance device management. For example:

- If you’re using Microsoft Intune for updates, use it for your Windows 11 Pro rollout.

- If you’re still using Microsoft Configuration Manager, perform in-place upgrades through Configuration Manager.

You can simplify and accelerate upgrades while beginning your move to cloud-native management by enabling co-management and moving the Windows Updates workload to Intune. Doing so allows you to schedule and deploy updates—including the Windows 11 upgrade—using Windows Autopatch, giving your organization the flexibility to maintain a level of control that suits your needs. With this approach, you can immediately take advantage of:

- Cloud-delivered driver and firmware updates
- Simplified configuration with automatic gradual rollouts
- Safeguard holds to protect against known compatibility issues
- Windows Update for Business reporting in Microsoft Intune

Enabling Windows Autopatch automates routine update management, freeing your IT team to focus on work that adds real value. Detailed reporting and actionable insights make it easier to secure your environment quickly. For example, one of Australia’s largest banks used Windows 11 Enterprise and Windows Autopatch to transform its IT department, enabling secure, flexible, and inclusive work across the organization.

From a provisioning standpoint, we recommend using Windows Autopilot to deploy new Windows 11 devices in a cloud-native way. These devices are natively joined to Microsoft Entra ID and managed through Microsoft Intune. We understand that moving your entire fleet to cloud-native management takes time. However, you don’t need to continue provisioning Windows 10 PCs with legacy tools. Instead, deploy new Windows 11 devices now using whichever tool you already use—this is the most efficient way to start modernizing your device management.

## Variation in device configuration increases total cost of ownership

**Reality**: *Your organization doesn’t need to wait until every device is upgraded or fully cloud-native to begin modernizing device management—strategic, phased upgrades allow you to move forward with minimal disruption.*

Multiple configurations reflect the diverse needs of your business. Most organizations have users with different roles and responsibilities, each requiring specific applications, tools, and settings to do their jobs effectively. Configuration complexity increases further when you factor in different geographies, languages, security requirements, regulatory standards, and more.

The same principle applies to Windows versioning. As you move to Windows 11, it’s likely that some devices will remain on various versions of Windows 10 while others are upgraded. If you’re transitioning to cloud-native management at the same time, you might end up managing a mix of versions and management or identity states.

There are strategies to reduce disruption during this transition and control total cost of ownership. Moving as many workloads as possible to Intune—not only for cloud-native devices but also for your existing devices—gives you a single, unified view of your entire device estate.

For new devices, deploy them as Windows 11 and manage them cloud-natively. For existing devices, perform in-place upgrades to Windows 11 and transition individual devices from hybrid to Microsoft Entra joined during the next planned device refresh. You can leave a device in a hybrid state until it's replaced or opportunistically when the device needs reimaging or reprovisioning. Many organizations have successfully used this approach to complete their cloud-native transition with minimal disruption.

## Application compatibility is a risk when upgrading to Windows 11

**Reality**: *Application compatibility is rarely a barrier when moving to Windows 11, because the platform is built on the same foundation as Windows 10 and maintains most existing app workflows and investments.*

Windows 11 is built on the same foundation as Windows 10, enhancing its strengths while addressing its limitations. It delivers improved security, productivity, and user experiences, all while preserving your existing app investments and workflows. As a continuation of Windows 10 servicing, Windows 11 maintains the same application compatibility you expect with Windows 10-to-Windows 10 feature updates.

Since its initial release, organizations upgrading to Windows 11 observed that applications that ran on Windows 10 continue to run on Windows 11 without issues. In fact, **app compatibility between Windows 10 and Windows 11 is higher than 99.7%**. You can be confident that the application compatibility processes used for Windows 10 upgrades don't to be repeated for Windows 11. Most organizations and independent software vendors don't need to test each application to deploy Windows 11 because they work.

In the unlikely event that you encounter a compatibility issue, you have tools available to identify and resolve it. The Microsoft App Assure service can help you proactively analyze your app portfolio, fix or shim apps that might need adjustments, and monitor app performance and reliability on Windows 11 both before and after your upgrade.

| Metric | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Evaluated apps | Over **1 million applications** evaluated to ensure compatibility with Windows 11 and other Microsoft updates. |
| Devices unblocked | Nearly **146 million devices** have been unblocked, enabling organizations to deploy updates without disruption. |
| Escalations prevented | **55.5 million support escalations avoided**, reducing IT workload and minimizing downtime for users. |
| Estimated customer cost saved | Approximately **USD9.6 billion** saved in customer costs by preventing compatibility issues, support escalations, and productivity loss. |

## Why do these misconceptions persist?

Many of these myths have their roots in the way IT has traditionally operated. For years, organizations relied on physical servers, manual processes, and local expertise to keep systems running. Change can be challenging, especially when it involves new technology and unfamiliar workflows. It’s natural to question whether new solutions disrupt what works or introduce new risks.

However, as cloud-native tools and Windows 11 continue to evolve, the benefits—flexibility, control, security, and efficiency—are becoming clearer. By understanding the realities behind these misconceptions, you can make informed decisions, plan transitions confidently, and take full advantage of what modern technology offers.

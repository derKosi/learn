## Step 1: Open your workspace

1. Open Excel with your financial dataset (three years of revenue and volume data). You can use the dataset provided here if needed.
2. Open a new PowerPoint deck to build your presentation slides.
3. Use Snap Layouts to arrange Excel and PowerPoint side by side so you can work between programs easily.

## Step 2: Prompt Copilot in Excel

1. Select the **Copilot icon** on the Home Ribbon.
2. In the Copilot sidebar, select the hamburger menu to open the list of available agents. Then choose **Analyst**.

3. Enter a clear prompt, for example:

   - Calculate growth metrics:
      - `"Calculate CAGR for Revenue and Volume from 2022 to 2024."`
      - `"Calculate Year-over-Year % change for each quarter."`

   - Generate textual insights:
      - `"Summarize trends and higlight key insights for executives."`
      - `"Identify top-performing quarters and regions."`

   - Create charts:
      - `"Generate a line chart for Revenue over the last three years."`
      - `"Generate a bar chart for Volume by quarter."`

4. Press **Enter**. Copilot provides:  
   - Calculated CAGR for revenue and volume
   - YoY percentage changes  
   - A textual summary of trends

> [!NOTE]
> Copilot might ask a few follow-up questions to better understand your request. Answer these to help it generate accurate output.

## Step 3: Review and refine insights

1. Check Copilot’s calculations for accuracy.  
2. To refine results, use other prompts like:  
   - `"Summarize key trends in 2-3 sentences for executives."`  
   - `"Add a bulleted list of top performing regions."`

### Sample insights generated by Copilot

- Revenue growth: Revenue increased from USD48.2M in Q1 2022 to USD72.0M in Q4 2024.
- CAGR (Revenue): approx. 14.6%
- Volume growth: Volume increased from 210K units to 298K units over the same period.
- CAGR (Volume): approx. 12.4%
- Trend summary: Revenue growth slightly outpaces volume growth, suggesting improved pricing or product mix. Net profit margin remains steady around 35-38%.

## Step 4: Generate graphs

1. Ask Copilot to create graphs for visual representation:  
  `"Generate a line chart for revenue over the last 3 years and a bar chart for volume."`

   [![A bar chart in Excel showing volume over three years illustrated with green bars.](../media/volume-inline.png)](../media/volume-expanded.png)

2. Verify **chart titles, axis labels, and legends**. You can use prompts to further customize the charts. For example, "Make the bars in our graph purple."

## Step 5: Transfer graphs and insights to PowerPoint

1. Copy or download the graphs from Excel.

2. Paste the graphs into the corresponding **PowerPoint slides**.  
3. Add **Copilot-generated textual insights** below or next to each graph.

## Step 6: Refine presentation with Copilot

1. Select the **Copilot icon** in PowerPoint.

2. Enter prompts like:  
   - `"Summarize the charts into concise bullet points for executives."`  
   - `"Rewrite insights in a professional and clear tone."`

3. Review the suggestions and integrate them into your slides.

## Step 7: Final review checklist

- Are **CAGR** and **YoY** calculations correct?  
- Are **charts clear and labeled appropriately**?  
- Are **insights actionable and easy to understand**?  
- Is **slide layout logical and visually consistent**?  
- Are **recommendations highlighted** for stakeholder decision-making?

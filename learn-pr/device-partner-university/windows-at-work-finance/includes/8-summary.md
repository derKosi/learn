Your company is preparing a quarterly financial review, and you needed to analyze three years of revenue and volume data, generate actionable insights, and create a stakeholder-ready presentation. In this module, you learned how to use Microsoft 365 Copilot in Excel with the Analyst agent to calculate CAGR and Year-over-Year changes, highlight trends, generate visualizations, and summarize key findings. You then used Copilot to refine slide content, summarize insights, and ensure all key metrics—including objectives, regional performance, and KPIs—were clearly presented.

Without Copilot and the Analyst agent, performing this analysis would require manual calculations, chart creation, and repeated iterations to summarize insights for executives, which can be time-consuming and prone to error. By using Copilot and Analyst in Microsoft 365, you streamlined data analysis, reduced back-and-forth revisions, and produced a clear, actionable presentation efficiently. This not only saves time but also improves alignment and decision-making across finance and executive teams, enabling faster and more strategic business outcomes.

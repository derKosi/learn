Before taking action, it’s important to understand what an anomalous sign-in alert is and why investigating it matters.

## What is an anomalous sign-in alert?

An anomalous sign-in alert occurs when a user’s sign in activity deviates from their normal behavior, such as signing in from unexpected locations, devices, or IP addresses. These alerts help IT administrators quickly identify potential account compromises. For example, an impossible travel alert occurs when a single user account signs in from two locations that are geographically impossible to reach within the observed timeframe.

Effective investigations are:

- **Alert-focused**: Identify the specific activity and impacted accounts.
- **Data-driven**: Use device logs, sign-in history, and related alerts to understand context.
- **Actionable**: Produce clear recommendations for remediation, escalation, or monitoring.
- **Collaborative**: Document findings in a way that can be shared with other team members or stakeholders.

> [!NOTE]
> Investigating an alert isn't the same as full incident response. The focus here's on assessing the legitimacy of the activity and gathering enough context to decide the next steps.

## Why investigating these alerts matters

- **Faster detection of compromised accounts**: Identify threats before they escalate.
- **Consistency in response**: Structured investigations reduce mistakes and ensure every alert is handled systematically.
- **Improved reporting and auditability**: Clear documentation supports handoff, trend analysis, and compliance.

## Core components of an effective investigation

| Step | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Review alert details** | Examine user, device, location, and timestamp information. |
| **Collect related activity** | Look at recent sign-ins, device logs, and related alerts. |
| **Correlate and analyze** | Identify patterns, anomalies, or links to other potential threats. |
| **Document findings** | Record observations, evidence, and preliminary conclusions. |
| **Recommend actions** | Suggest remediation, monitoring, or escalation steps. |

IT administrators investigate security alerts, review activity across devices and accounts, and determine the appropriate response. Microsoft Security Copilot streamlines these tasks by providing context, insights, and guidance—helping admins act quickly and confidently.

Imagine this: A user has triggered an alert for an impossible travel sign-in—their account appears to have been accessed from multiple locations in a very short time. You need to determine whether this is a legitimate threat or a false positive.

By the end of this module, you’ll be able to investigate an impossible travel or anomalous sign-in alert using Microsoft Security Copilot and decide whether the activity represents a real security threat.

## Learning objectives

- Investigate an anomalous sign-in or impossible travel alert using Microsoft Security Copilot.
- Correlate alerts with user activity, device logs, and related security events.
- Use Copilot to summarize findings, document potential threats, and recommend next steps for escalation.

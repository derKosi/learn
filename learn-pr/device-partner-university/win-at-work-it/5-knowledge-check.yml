          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Anomalous sign-in alerts flag unusual or suspicious sign-in activity."
        - content: "A system notification about software updates."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This is unrelated to sign-in activity."
        - content: "A reminder to change passwords regularly."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Password reminders aren't considered anomalous alerts."
  - content: "Which of the following steps are part of investigating an anomalous sign-in alert?"
    choices:
        - content: "Review alert details, collect related activity, correlate patterns, document findings, recommend actions"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. These are the core steps for investigating sign-in alerts."
        - content: "Delete user accounts immediately"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Immediate deletion isn't part of standard investigation procedures."
        - content: "Ignore alerts that appear during nonbusiness hours"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Alerts must be investigated regardless of timing."
        - content: "Only monitor future activity without reviewing past logs"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Reviewing past activity is essential to determine anomalies."
  - content: "How does Microsoft Security Copilot assist IT administrators?"
    choices:
        - content: "Automatically disables user accounts"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Copilot doesn't take automatic blocking actions."
        - content: "Summarizes alerts, correlates sign-in activity, and drafts investigation reports"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. These are the main ways Copilot helps administrators."
        - content: "Removes all anomalous sign-ins from logs"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Copilot doesn't modify log data."
        - content: "Generates passwords for users"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Password generation is unrelated to investigating alerts."
  - content: "What defines an impossible travel alert?"
    choices:
        - content: "When a user logs in from a single location repeatedly"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Repeated logins from one location are normal behavior."
        - content: "When a user account signs in from two geographically distant locations within a time frame that makes travel impossible"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. This is the definition of an impossible travel alert."
        - content: "When a user forgets their password multiple times"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Password issues are unrelated to sign-in anomalies."
        - content: "When an alert is triggered outside business hours"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Timing alone doesn't define impossible travel."
  - content: "Why is documenting findings important in an investigation?"
    choices:
        - content: "It helps ensure consistent analysis and provides a record for escalation or reporting."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Documentation ensures investigations are clear, repeatable, and actionable."
        - content: "It replaces the need for further monitoring."

        - content: "It's only necessary for audits."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. While useful for audits, documenting findings is critical for real-time decision-making."
        - content: "It allows you to skip alert investigation in the future."

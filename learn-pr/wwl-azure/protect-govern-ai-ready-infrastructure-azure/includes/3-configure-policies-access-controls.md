Consider a scenario where your data science team wants to deploy Azure OpenAI models across development, staging, and production environments. Without governance, developers might choose the most convenient Azure region regardless of data residency requirements, use default encryption that doesn't meet security standards, or deploy expensive SKUs in test environments that inflate costs. Azure Policy definitions prevent these issues by validating resource configurations before deployment succeeds.

With Azure Policy, you define rules once and enforce them consistently. For example, an "Allowed locations" policy restricts Azure OpenAI deployments to European regions only, ensuring regulatory compliance by preventing data transfer outside the EU. When a developer attempts to create a resource in an unauthorized region, the deployment fails immediately with a clear error message explaining the violation and suggesting compliant alternatives. This becomes especially important for organizations operating in multiple regulatory jurisdictions: you assign different policy sets to subscriptions based on their data classification, automatically adapting controls to each workload's risk profile.

Encryption and configuration policies enforce consistent security and cost controls across AI resources.
- Policy enforcement requires customer‑managed keys in Azure Key Vault for services processing sensitive data, preventing deployments without approved encryption.
- Policies also restrict unsupported SKU tiers, reducing the risk of accidental cost overruns from inappropriate resource pricing choices.

Identity-based access controls ensure resources are accessed only under appropriate conditions.
- Microsoft Entra ID conditional access evaluates user context, such as device compliance and location, before granting access to AI roles.
- Adaptive controls require stronger authentication for higher‑risk scenarios, blocking access from unmanaged or noncompliant devices.

Role-based access control aligns permissions with job responsibilities and enforces separation of duties.
- Built-in RBAC roles provide scoped access for common tasks, such as consumption, configuration, and usage monitoring.
- Custom roles allow organizations to separate development and approval responsibilities, reducing the risk of unauthorized or unreviewed production deployments.


Security engineers typically assign policies at the subscription or resource group scope to balance governance coverage with administrative overhead. A policy assigned to the subscription affects all resources within that subscription, providing broad protection with minimal configuration. However, resource group scoping enables exceptions for legitimate scenarios—for example, a research group might receive an exemption from the standard SKU policy to experiment with premium-tier features, while production resource groups remain strictly governed. Organizations document exception processes that require business justification, security review, and time-limited approvals, ensuring that policy exemptions don't create permanent compliance gaps.

With policies and access controls working together, you establish defense in depth: policies prevent misconfigured resources from being created, conditional access protects against compromised credentials or unauthorized access attempts, and RBAC limits damage from insider threats by restricting each user to the minimum permissions required for their role. This layered approach addresses multiple attack vectors simultaneously while maintaining developer productivity through clear guardrails rather than blanket restrictions.

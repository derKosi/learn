Your organization deployed Azure OpenAI agents across three departments—sales, customer service, and product development. Within the first week, the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) raised urgent concerns: customer service agents are processing personal health information without documented safeguards, sales teams are storing prompts containing proprietary pricing strategies in unencrypted logs, and no one can answer the compliance auditor's question about who approved the model deployment. Without clear governance, you risk exposing sensitive data, violating regulatory or HIPAA regulations, and losing stakeholder trust in your AI initiatives.

This module equips you to implement comprehensive AI governance using Microsoft Foundry and Azure AI services. You configure Azure Policy definitions that automatically enforce encryption and regional restrictions, establish Microsoft Entra ID access controls that protect sensitive resources through least-privilege principles, implement Azure AI Content Safety filters that prevent harmful outputs while maintaining operational efficiency, and create monitoring workflows through Azure Monitor and Microsoft Purview that provide audit trails for compliance reviews. By the end, you demonstrate to auditors and leadership that your AI operations balance innovation velocity with risk management and regulatory adherence.

In this module, you learn to:

- Evaluate AI governance requirements and align them with Microsoft Foundry capabilities
- Configure Azure Policy and role-based access controls for AI workloads
- Implement content filtering and responsible AI safeguards using Azure AI services
- Establish monitoring and audit trails for AI operations using Azure Monitor and Microsoft Purview
- Apply governance best practices for model lifecycle management and data protection

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Familiarity with Azure fundamentals including resource groups, subscriptions, and the Azure portal
- Basic understanding of AI and machine learning concepts such as models, prompts, and completions
- Experience navigating the Azure portal and executing Azure CLI commands

Code performance optimization is a critical aspect of software development that directly impacts user experience and business success. While functional correctness is essential, applications that run slowly or consume excessive resources can frustrate users and lead to lost revenue. GitHub Copilot provides powerful AI-assisted capabilities to help developers identify performance bottlenecks, understand code efficiency patterns, and implement optimizations that maintain code quality while improving performance.

Imagine you're a developer working on an e-commerce application that's experiencing slow response times during peak traffic periods. Customers are abandoning their shopping carts due to page load delays, and your business is losing revenue. You need to quickly identify the performance bottlenecks in your codebase and implement effective optimizations. With GitHub Copilot's Ask and Agent modes, you can analyze your code to understand where performance issues occur, get suggestions for improvements, and refactor critical sections while ensuring you don't introduce new bugs or security vulnerabilities.

The topics covered in this module include:

- Understanding performance profiling and code efficiency principles.
- Learning techniques for writing efficient and readable code.
- Measuring code performance and establishing baseline metrics.
- Using GitHub Copilot Ask mode to identify performance bottlenecks.
- Refactoring low-performance code using GitHub Copilot Agent mode.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe what code profiling is and how improving code efficiency benefits users and businesses.
- Describe the tools, techniques, and processes used to implement profiling, locate bottlenecks, and improve code performance.
- Use GitHub Copilot's Ask mode to explain a codebase, suggest opportunities to improve code efficiency, and identify the risks associated with suggested performance optimizations.
- Use GitHub Copilot's Agent mode to refactor low performance code without negatively impacting code quality or code security.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To complete this GitHub Copilot training, you must have an active subscription for GitHub Copilot in your personal GitHub account (includes the GitHub Copilot Free plan), or you must be assigned to a subscription managed by an organization or enterprise. Module activities might include GitHub Copilot suggestions that match public code. If you're a member of an organization on GitHub Enterprise Cloud who is assigned to a GitHub Copilot subscription through your organization, the setting for suggestions matching public code might be inherited from your organization or enterprise. If your account blocks suggestions that match public code, module activities might not work as expected.

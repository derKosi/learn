By the end of Unit 1, you should appreciate *why* profiling and performance tuning are worth your attention and understand that a methodical, measurement-driven approach is key. Next, we'll discuss how to write code that is efficient from the get-go (without losing clarity), before diving into measuring and improving performance.

You've gone from recognizing the importance of performance, to measuring it, to pinpointing issues with GitHub Copilot's help, and finally implementing solutions with GitHub Copilot's assistance. The result should be a codebase that:

- Performs better (faster, or more scalable, or more efficient resource usage).
- Remains readable and maintainable (thanks to targeted optimizations and careful review).
- Preserves correctness and security.

To internalize this process:

1. Always get a baseline. Know where you started.
2. Use tools (profilers, GitHub Copilot Ask) to find the actual bottleneck.
3. Plan the optimization.
4. Use GitHub Copilot to implement it quickly.
5. Test and measure again.
6. Iterate if needed.

By practicing this approach, you'll become proficient in performance tuning. And with GitHub Copilot as your AI partner, you can reach solutions faster, learning along the way.

Even in codebases beyond the ones we've discussed, these skills apply. Whenever you face a slow program or a need to scale up:

- Profile the code or scenario.
- Identify hotspots.
- Ask GitHub Copilot for insights on those hotspots.
- Apply fixes (with GitHub Copilot's help to code it).
- Validate improvement.

This methodical approach, augmented by AI, is a powerful workflow for modern developers.

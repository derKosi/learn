In this module, you learned how to identify and optimize code performance issues using GitHub Copilot. You implemented performance profiling techniques to analyze a .NET application and used GitHub Copilot to refactor inefficient code while maintaining quality and security.

The main takeaway from this module is the ability to use GitHub Copilot's Ask and Agent modes to systematically improve application performance. This approach enables you to quickly identify performance bottlenecks, understand the impact of code inefficiencies on user experience and business success, and implement targeted optimizations. You also learned how to establish baseline performance metrics, create effective prompts for performance analysis, and refactor low-performance code without introducing bugs or security vulnerabilities. These skills are essential for maintaining high-performing applications that provide excellent user experiences and support business objectives.

You can apply the knowledge gained in this module to optimize existing applications, prevent performance issues during development, and collaborate with team members to establish performance standards. Learning about GitHub Copilot's performance optimization capabilities enhances your ability to deliver fast, efficient applications that scale effectively and provide competitive advantages for your organization.

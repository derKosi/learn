> To complete this exercise, you need an active GitHub account and a Visual Studio Code environment configured for C# development. For help with configuring your lab environment, see [Configure lab environment for GitHub Copilot Labs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2320147&azure-portal=true). For help with enabling GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code, see [Enable GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2320158&azure-portal=true).

In this exercise, you use GitHub Copilot to identify and address performance bottlenecks and code inefficiencies in an e-commerce order processing application. You analyze the existing codebase, identify areas for improvement, refactor the code using GitHub Copilot, and test the refactored code to ensure performance enhancements while maintaining functionality.

Tasks include:

- Reviewing the existing codebase and establishing baseline performance metrics.
- Identifying performance bottlenecks using GitHub Copilot Chat (Ask mode).
- Refactoring performance-critical code using GitHub Copilot Chat (Agent mode).
- Testing and verifying the refactored code.

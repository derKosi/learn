**Desired State Configuration (DSC)** is a configuration management approach that you can use for configuration, deployment, and management of systems to ensure that an environment is maintained in a state that you specify (**defined state**) and doesn't deviate from that state.

**DSC** helps eliminate **configuration drift** and ensures the state is maintained for compliance, security, and performance.

## What is Windows PowerShell DSC?

**Windows PowerShell DSC** is a management platform in **PowerShell** that provides desired state configuration capabilities. **PowerShell DSC** enables you to manage, deploy, and enforce configurations for physical or virtual machines, including **Windows** and **Linux** systems.

## DSC components

**DSC** consists of three primary components:

### Configurations

**Configurations** are declarative **PowerShell** scripts that define and configure instances of resources. Upon running the configuration, **DSC** (and the resources being called by the configuration) will apply the configuration, ensuring that the system exists in the state laid out by the configuration.

**DSC configurations** are **idempotent:** The **Local Configuration Manager (LCM)** will ensure that machines are configured in whatever state the configuration declares, regardless of how many times the configuration is applied.

### Resources

**Resources** contain the code that puts and keeps the target of a configuration in the specified state. **Resources** are in **PowerShell modules** and can be written to a model as generic as a file or a **Windows** process or as specific as a **Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS)** server or a VM running in **Azure**.

### Local Configuration Manager (LCM)

The **Local Configuration Manager (LCM)** runs on the nodes or machines you wish to configure. It's the engine by which **DSC** facilitates the interaction between resources and configurations. The **LCM** regularly polls the system using the control flow implemented by resources to maintain the state defined by a configuration. If the system is out of state, the **LCM** calls the code in resources to apply the configuration according to specified.

## DSC implementation methods

There are two methods of implementing **DSC:**

### Push mode

**Push mode:** A user actively applies a configuration to a target node and pushes out the configuration. This method is useful for testing and immediate configuration application.

### Pull mode

**Pull mode:** Pull clients are automatically configured to get their desired state configurations from a remote pull service. This remote pull service is provided by a **pull server** that acts as central control and manager for the configurations, ensures that nodes conform to the desired state, and reports on their compliance status.

The **pull server** can be set up as an **SMB-based pull server** or an **HTTPS-based server**. **HTTPS-based pull server** uses the **Open Data Protocol (OData)** with the **OData Web service** to communicate using **REST APIs**. This is the preferred model, as it can be centrally managed and controlled. The following diagram provides an outline of the workflow of **DSC pull mode:**

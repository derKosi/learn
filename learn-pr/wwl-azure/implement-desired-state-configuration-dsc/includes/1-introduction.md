This module describes **Desired State Configuration (DSC)** and its components for implementation with **Azure Automation**. Learn to manage configuration drift, create DSC configurations, implement DSC for **Linux** environments, and plan for hybrid management scenarios.

## Module overview

**Desired State Configuration (DSC)** is a configuration management approach that ensures your infrastructure remains in a specified state and doesn't deviate over time. **DSC** helps prevent configuration drift, maintain compliance, and enforce security standards across your environment.

This module covers **DSC** fundamentals, **Azure Automation State Configuration**, creating DSC configuration files, and implementing DSC for both **Windows** and **Linux** systems.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- **Understand configuration drift:** Identify how and why infrastructure configurations change over time and the security implications.
- **Implement Desired State Configuration (DSC):** Use **PowerShell DSC** to define and enforce desired states for resources.
- **Describe Azure Automation State Configuration:** Use **Azure Automation** as a DSC pull server for centralized configuration management.
- **Create DSC configuration files:** Write **PowerShell** scripts with configuration blocks, nodes, and resources.
- **Implement DSC for Linux:** Apply **DSC** to **Linux** environments on **Azure**.
- **Plan for hybrid management:** Manage both **Azure** and on-premises resources with **DSC**.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of **Azure Automation** and automation accounts.
- Basic knowledge of **PowerShell** scripting.
- Familiarity with infrastructure as code concepts.
- Experience with **Azure** resources and virtual machines.

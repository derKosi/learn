Effective project planning and agile work management are essential for successful software delivery. This module introduces you to two powerful platforms for agile planning: GitHub Projects and Azure Boards. You'll learn how these tools can work together to create seamless workflows between development and project management, enabling teams to plan, track, and deliver value more efficiently.

## Real-world agile planning success

Modern software teams require flexible, collaborative tools that adapt to changing requirements. Microsoft's development teams use agile planning tools to coordinate thousands of developers across multiple teams and product groups, ensuring alignment while maintaining autonomy. Teams across Microsoft leverage Azure Boards integrated with GitHub to manage complex product portfolios spanning cloud services, productivity tools, and developer platforms, demonstrating the power of integrated agile planning at enterprise scale.

## Why agile planning matters

Effective agile planning provides several key benefits:

- **Improved visibility**: Stakeholders can see progress and upcoming work at a glance
- **Better collaboration**: Teams can coordinate dependencies and share context
- **Faster delivery**: Streamlined workflows reduce administrative overhead
- **Enhanced quality**: Clear requirements and acceptance criteria reduce defects
- **Adaptive planning**: Teams can respond quickly to changing priorities and feedback

## Your learning journey

This comprehensive module will equip you with practical skills to implement agile planning using industry-leading tools. You'll learn both theoretical concepts and hands-on techniques through real-world scenarios and best practices.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- **Compare and contrast** GitHub Projects and Azure Boards capabilities and use cases
- **Integrate platforms** by linking Azure Boards and GitHub for seamless workflows
- **Configure and optimize** GitHub Projects and boards for team productivity
- **Customize views and workflows** to match your team's specific needs
- **Implement feedback cycles** and traceability for continuous improvement
- **Scale agile practices** across multiple teams and portfolios

title: Implement a Versioning Strategy
summary: This module explains versioning strategies for packaging, semantic versioning principles, package promotion workflows, and best practices for managing package versions throughout the software development lifecycle. Learn to use Azure Artifacts views to indicate package quality and implement automated versioning in CI/CD pipelines.
abstract: |
  By the end of this module, you're able to:

  -   Understand the importance of versioning for package management and dependency tracking
  -   Implement semantic versioning (SemVer 2.0) for consistent version numbering
  -   Use Azure Artifacts views (@Local, @Prerelease, @Release) to manage package quality
  -   Promote packages through different views based on quality levels
  -   Push packages from build pipelines with appropriate version numbers
  -   Apply best practices for versioning strategies in DevOps workflows
prerequisites: |
  -   Basic understanding of DevOps concepts and CI/CD pipelines
  -   Familiarity with package management and dependency management principles
  -   Experience with Azure DevOps or similar CI/CD platforms
  -   Knowledge of software versioning concepts is beneficial

**Azure Artifacts** has the notion of **promoting packages** to views to indicate that a version is of a certain **quality level**.

By selectively promoting packages, you can plan when packages have a certain **quality** and are ready to be released and supported by the consumers.

## Package promotion fundamentals

You can **promote packages** to one of the available views as the **quality indicator**.

**Promotion concept:**

- **Quality gates:** Views represent different quality levels.
- **Explicit action:** Promotion is an explicit decision.
- **No version change:** Package version remains the same.
- **Metadata change:** Only the view association changes.

### Default views for promotion

**Release** and **Prerelease's** two views might be sufficient, but you can create more views when you want finer-grained quality levels if necessary, such as `alpha` and `beta`.

**Common promotion workflows:**

```
@Local → @Prerelease → @Release
@Local → @Alpha → @Beta → @RC → @Release
```

## Package visibility rules

**Packages** will always show in the **Local view**, but only in a particular view after being promoted.

### View-based package listing

Depending on the **URL** used to connect to the feed, the available packages will be listed.

**Visibility matrix:**

| Package State          | @Local | @Prerelease | @Release |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ----------- | -------- |
| Just published         | Yes    | No          | No       |
| Promoted to Prerelease | Yes    | Yes         | No       |
| Promoted to Release    | Yes    | Yes         | Yes      |

**Key principles:**

- **@Local always shows all:** Every package appears in @Local regardless of promotion.
- **Other views require promotion:** Packages must be explicitly promoted to appear in other views.
- **Cumulative visibility:** Promoting to @Release doesn't remove from @Prerelease.

## Upstream sources and views

**Upstream** sources will only be evaluated when using the **@Local view** of the feed.

### Upstream package workflow

After they've been downloaded and cached in the **@Local view**, you can see and resolve the packages in other views after being promoted to it.

**Upstream package lifecycle:**

1.  **Request package:** Consumer requests package from @Local view.
2.  **Upstream check:** Azure Artifacts checks upstream sources if not in feed.
3.  **Download and cache:** Package downloaded from upstream and cached in @Local.
4.  **Local only:** Package now available in @Local view.
5.  **Promotion:** Package can be promoted to @Prerelease or @Release views.

**Example workflow:**

```
Developer requests lodash@4.17.21 from @Local view
↓
Azure Artifacts checks npmjs.com (upstream source)
↓
Package downloaded and cached in @Local view
↓
Package available in feed, can be promoted
↓
Promote to @Release for production use
```

**Important notes:**

- Upstream only with @Local: Other views don't trigger upstream source evaluation.
- Cache first: Once cached, package is treated like any other feed package.
- Promotion control: Control which upstream packages are approved for production.

## Deciding when to promote

**It's up to you to decide how and when to promote packages to a specific view.**

### Promotion criteria

**Common promotion triggers:**

#### Promote to @Prerelease

- **Build success:** Package built successfully in CI pipeline.
- **Unit tests passed:** All unit tests pass.
- **Code quality:** Code quality gates met (coverage, static analysis).
- **Initial validation:** Basic smoke tests passed.

#### Promote to @Release

- **Integration tests:** Integration tests passed successfully.
- **QA approval:** Quality assurance team approves.
- **Security scan:** Security vulnerability scan passed.
- **Performance validated:** Performance tests meet requirements.
- **Documentation complete:** Release notes and documentation finalized.

### Manual versus automated promotion

**Manual promotion:**

- **Human judgment:** Requires human decision.
- **Complex criteria:** When criteria are difficult to automate.
- **High-risk packages:** Critical packages requiring extra scrutiny.

**Automated promotion:**

- **Consistent criteria:** When criteria are clear and testable.
- **Frequent releases:** High-velocity development teams.
- **Lower-risk packages:** Internal libraries with good test coverage.

## Automating package promotion

This process can be **automated** by using an **Azure Pipelines task** as part of the build pipeline.

### Using Azure Pipelines for promotion

**Azure Pipelines task for promotion:**

```yaml
# Promote package to Prerelease view
- task: UniversalPackages@0
  inputs:
    command: "publish"
    publishDirectory: "$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)"
    feedsToUsePublish: "internal"
    vstsFeedPublish: "MyFeed"
    vstsFeedPackagePublish: "my-package"
    packagePublishDescription: "Package from build $(Build.BuildNumber)"

# Promote to Release view after tests
- task: AzureCLI@2
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: "Azure Subscription"
    scriptType: "bash"
    scriptLocation: "inlineScript"
    inlineScript: |
      az artifacts universal promote \
        --organization https://dev.azure.com/MyOrg \
        --feed MyFeed \
        --name my-package \
        --version $(packageVersion) \
        --view Release
```

### Multi-stage pipeline example

**Complete pipeline with promotion gates:**

```yaml
trigger:
  - main

stages:
  # Build and publish to Local
  - stage: Build
    jobs:
      - job: BuildPackage
        steps:
          - script: dotnet pack -o $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)
            displayName: "Build package"

          - task: NuGetCommand@2
            inputs:
              command: "push"
              packagesToPush: "$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/**/*.nupkg"
              nuGetFeedType: "internal"
              publishVstsFeed: "MyFeed"

  # Promote to Prerelease after unit tests
  - stage: PromoteToPrerelease
    dependsOn: Build
    jobs:
      - job: RunTests
        steps:
          - script: dotnet test
            displayName: "Run unit tests"

          - task: AzureCLI@2
            displayName: "Promote to Prerelease"
            inputs:
              azureSubscription: "Azure Subscription"
              scriptType: "bash"
              scriptLocation: "inlineScript"
              inlineScript: |
                az artifacts universal promote \
                  --organization https://dev.azure.com/MyOrg \
                  --feed MyFeed \
                  --name MyPackage \
                  --version $(Build.BuildNumber) \
                  --view Prerelease

  # Promote to Release after integration tests and approval
  - stage: PromoteToRelease
    dependsOn: PromoteToPrerelease
    jobs:
      - job: IntegrationTests
        steps:
          - script: dotnet test --filter Category=Integration
            displayName: "Run integration tests"

      - deployment: PromoteToRelease
        dependsOn: IntegrationTests
        environment: "Production-Approval"
        strategy:
          runOnce:
            deploy:
              steps:
                - task: AzureCLI@2
                  displayName: "Promote to Release"
                  inputs:
                    azureSubscription: "Azure Subscription"
                    scriptType: "bash"
                    scriptLocation: "inlineScript"
                    inlineScript: |
                      az artifacts universal promote \
                        --organization https://dev.azure.com/MyOrg \
                        --feed MyFeed \
                        --name MyPackage \
                        --version $(Build.BuildNumber) \
                        --view Release
```

## Manual promotion via web interface

**Promote packages through Azure DevOps portal:**

1.  **Navigate to Artifacts:** Go to Artifacts in Azure DevOps.
2.  **Select feed:** Choose the feed containing your package.
3.  **Find package:** Locate the package version to promote.
4.  **Package details:** Select the package to view details.
5.  **Promote button:** Select the "Promote" button.
6.  **Select view:** Choose the target view (@Prerelease or @Release).
7.  **Confirm:** Confirm the promotion.

## Promotion and retention policies

**Packages that have been promoted to a view won't be deleted based on the retention policies.**

### Retention protection

**Promotion provides retention protection:**

- **@Local packages:** Subject to retention policies.
- **Promoted packages:** Protected from automatic deletion.
- **Long-term storage:** Released packages kept indefinitely.

**Retention policy behavior:**

| View        | Retention Policy                   | Protected |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | --------- |
| @Local only | Applies                            | No        |
| @Prerelease | Applies to @Local, not @Prerelease | Yes       |
| @Release    | Applies to @Local, not @Release    | Yes       |

**Example:**

```
Feed retention policy: Keep only last 30 days in @Local

Package version 1.0.0:
- Published to @Local on Day 1
- Promoted to @Release on Day 5
- Day 31: Still available because promoted to @Release
- Would be deleted if not promoted
```

### Configuring retention policies

**Set retention policies per feed:**

1.  **Feed settings:** Navigate to feed settings.
2.  **Retention policies:** Select retention policy section.
3.  **Configure:** Set maximum days to keep packages in @Local.
4.  **Save:** Apply the policy.

**Best practices:**

- **Promote important packages:** Ensure important packages are promoted.
- **Regular cleanup:** Let retention policies clean up unpromoted packages.
- **Balance storage:** Balance between storage costs and retention needs.

## Promotion best practices

**Clear criteria:**

- **Document promotion criteria:** Define what qualifies a package for each view.
- **Consistent application:** Apply criteria consistently across all packages.
- **Team alignment:** Ensure team understands promotion workflows.

**Automation:**

- **Automate when possible:** Automate promotion for clear criteria.
- **Manual gates for critical packages:** Use manual approval for production promotions.
- **Testing before promotion:** Always test before promoting.

**Communication:**

- **Release notes:** Include release notes when promoting to @Release.
- **Change logs:** Maintain changelog of what changed in each version.
- **Notifications:** Notify consumers when packages are promoted to @Release.

**Rollback strategy:**

- **Keep previous versions:** Don't delete previous @Release versions.
- **Quick rollback:** Allow consumers to quickly revert to previous versions.
- **Version pinning:** Support consumers pinning to specific versions.

## Monitoring package promotions

**Track promotion history:**

- **Audit logs:** Azure DevOps logs all promotion activities.
- **Package history:** View promotion history for each package.
- **Reports:** Generate reports on promotion patterns.

**Metrics to track:**

- **Time to promote:** How long from @Local to @Release.
- **Promotion failures:** Packages that fail promotion criteria.
- **Rollback rate:** How often packages need to be rolled back.
- **Promotion velocity:** Number of promotions per time period.

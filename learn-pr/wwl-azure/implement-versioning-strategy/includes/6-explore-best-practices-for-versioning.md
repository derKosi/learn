There are several **best practices** to effectively use versions, views, and promotion flow for your **versioning strategy**.

## Core versioning best practices

Here's a couple of suggestions:

### 1. Have a documented versioning strategy

**Have a documented versioning strategy.**

**Why this matters:**

- **Consistency:** Everyone follows the same versioning rules.
- **Predictability:** Consumers know what to expect from version changes.
- **Onboarding:** New team members understand versioning approach.
- **Quality:** Reduces confusion and versioning mistakes.

**What to document:**

- **Versioning scheme:** Which scheme you use (SemVer, date-based, etc.).
- **Increment rules:** When to increment major, minor, patch.
- **Prerelease labels:** What labels mean (@alpha, @beta, @rc).
- **Promotion criteria:** What qualifies a package for each view.
- **Special cases:** How to handle hotfixes, backports, deprecated features.

**Example documentation:**

```markdown
# Versioning Strategy

## Version Format

We use Semantic Versioning 2.0 (Major.Minor.Patch-label)

## Increment Rules

- Major: Breaking changes, removed APIs
- Minor: New features, backward compatible
- Patch: Bug fixes only

## Prerelease Labels

- alpha: Early development, unstable
- beta: Feature complete, testing in progress
- rc: Release candidate, final testing

## Promotion Workflow

1. All packages start in @Local
2. Promote to @Prerelease after unit tests pass
3. Promote to @Release after QA approval and security scan
```

### 2. Adopt SemVer 2.0 for your versioning scheme

**Adopt SemVer 2.0 for your versioning scheme.**

**Benefits of Semantic Versioning:**

- **Industry standard:** Widely understood and adopted.
- **Clear communication:** Version numbers communicate intent.
- **Tool support:** Package managers understand SemVer.
- **Dependency management:** Enables automated dependency resolution.

**SemVer format:**

```
Major.Minor.Patch-prerelease+buildmetadata

Examples:
1.0.0
1.2.3
2.0.0-beta.1
1.0.0+build.123
```

**SemVer rules:**

- **MAJOR:** Increment when you make incompatible API changes.
- **MINOR:** Increment when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
- **PATCH:** Increment when you make backward-compatible bug fixes.
- **Prerelease:** Append hyphen and label for prereleases.
- **Build metadata:** Append plus and metadata for build information.

### 3. Each repository should only reference one feed

**Each repository should only reference one feed.**

**Why single feed per repository:**

- **Simplicity:** Easier to manage and configure.
- **Consistency:** All dependencies come from same source.
- **Security:** Single point for security scanning and approval.
- **Performance:** Faster package resolution with single feed.

**Implementation:**

```bash
# NuGet.config - Single feed
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <clear />
    <add key="MyFeed" value="https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/MyOrg/_packaging/MyFeed/nuget/v3/index.json" />
  </packageSources>
</configuration>
```

**Exception - Upstream sources:**

Instead of referencing multiple feeds, use **upstream sources** to aggregate multiple package sources into one feed.

```
Your Feed → Upstream to npmjs.com
         → Upstream to NuGet.org

Your repository → References only "Your Feed"
```

### 4. On package creation, automatically publish packages back to the feed

**On package creation, automatically publish packages back to the feed.**

**Benefits of automated publishing:**

- **Consistency:** Every build creates a package.
- **Traceability:** Each commit has an associated package.
- **CI/CD:** Enables continuous delivery workflows.
- **Early testing:** Packages available immediately for testing.

**Implementation in Azure Pipelines:**

```yaml
trigger:
  - main

pool:
  vmImage: "ubuntu-latest"

steps:
  # Build the package
  - script: dotnet pack --configuration Release
    displayName: "Build package"

  # Automatically publish to feed
  - task: NuGetCommand@2
    displayName: "Publish package to feed"
    inputs:
      command: "push"
      packagesToPush: "$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/**/*.nupkg"
      nuGetFeedType: "internal"
      publishVstsFeed: "MyFeed"
      allowPackageConflicts: false
```

## Additional best practices

### Use views for quality gates

**Leverage views to indicate package quality:**

- **@Local:** Development and testing.
- **@Prerelease:** QA and beta testing.
- **@Release:** Production-ready packages.

**Promotion workflow:**

```yaml
# Automated promotion based on tests
- stage: Promote
  condition: succeeded()
  jobs:
    - job: PromotePackage
      steps:
        - task: AzureCLI@2
          inputs:
            scriptType: "bash"
            inlineScript: |
              az artifacts universal promote \
                --feed MyFeed \
                --name MyPackage \
                --version $(Build.BuildNumber) \
                --view Release
```

### Never republish the same version

**Package immutability is critical:**

- **No overwrites:** Never publish same version twice with different content.
- **Version increment:** Always increment version for any change.
- **Trust:** Consumers trust versions don't change.

**If you need to fix a broken package:**

```
Wrong: Republish 1.2.3 with fixes
Right: Publish 1.2.4 with fixes
```

### Use retention policies wisely

**Balance storage costs with retention needs:**

- Promote important packages: Protected from deletion.
- Clean up @Local: Let retention policies clean up unpromoted packages.
- Keep release history: Always keep promoted versions.

**Example retention policy:**

```
@Local view: Keep last 30 days
@Prerelease view: Keep last 90 days
@Release view: Keep indefinitely
```

### Version source code and packages together

**Tag source code with package versions:**

```bash
# Tag commit with version number
git tag v1.2.3
git push origin v1.2.3
```

**Benefits:**

- **Traceability:** Link package to source code.
- **Debugging:** Find exact code that produced a package.
- **Reproducibility:** Rebuild package from tagged source.

### Include version in package metadata

**Comprehensive package metadata:**

```json
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "description": "Package description",
  "author": "Team Name",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/org/repo.git"
  },
  "releaseNotes": "Bug fixes and improvements"
}
```

### Test before promoting

**Always test before promotion:**

- **Unit tests:** Before promoting to @Prerelease.
- **Integration tests:** Before promoting to @Release.
- **Security scans:** Check for vulnerabilities.
- **Performance tests:** Ensure no performance degradation.

## Team adoption practices

**It's good to adopt a best practice yourself and share these with your development teams.**

### Integration with Definition of Done

**It can be made part of the Definition of Done for work items related to publishing and consuming packages from feeds.**

**Example Definition of Done items:**

- Package version follows SemVer 2.0.
- Package published to feed automatically.
- Source code tagged with version number.
- Unit tests pass before promoting to @Prerelease.
- Integration tests pass before promoting to @Release.
- Release notes included in package metadata.
- Security scan completed with no high/critical issues.
- Package promoted to appropriate view based on quality.

### Training and onboarding

**Share best practices with team:**

- **Documentation:** Maintain versioning guidelines document.
- **Training sessions:** Regular training on versioning practices.
- **Code reviews:** Review version increments during code reviews.
- **Templates:** Provide pipeline templates with best practices built in.

### Monitoring and enforcement

**Track compliance with best practices:**

- **Automated checks:** Build pipeline checks for versioning rules.
- **Reports:** Regular reports on versioning patterns.
- **Metrics:** Track version increment patterns, promotion velocity.
- **Audits:** Periodic audits of package versions and promotion history.

## Versioning anti-patterns to avoid

**Don't do these:**

### Manual version management

- **Problem:** Inconsistent, error-prone.
- **Solution:** Automate versioning in CI/CD pipeline.

### Skipping versions

- **Problem:** Creates gaps in version history.
- **Solution:** Increment sequentially for every change.

### Using dates as versions

- **Problem:** Doesn't communicate change scope.
- **Solution:** Use SemVer; dates can be in build metadata.

### Publishing without testing

- **Problem:** Broken packages reach consumers.
- **Solution:** Always test before publishing.

### No version strategy documentation

- **Problem:** Team confusion, inconsistent versions.
- **Solution:** Document and share strategy.

## Version strategy checklist

**Before implementing versioning strategy:**

- Documented versioning scheme (SemVer 2.0 recommended)
- Automated version generation in build pipeline
- Single feed per repository configuration
- Automated package publishing to feed
- View promotion workflow defined
- Retention policies configured
- Test gates before promotion
- Source code tagging with versions
- Team training completed
- Definition of Done updated

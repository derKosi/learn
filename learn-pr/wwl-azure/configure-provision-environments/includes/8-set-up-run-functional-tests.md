This lab will teach you how to execute Selenium test cases on a C\# web application as part of the Azure DevOps Release pipeline.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you'll be able to:

- Configure a self-hosted Azure DevOps agent.
- Configure the release pipeline.
- Trigger build and release.
- Run tests in Chrome and Firefox.

## Requirements

- This lab requires **Microsoft Edge** or an [Azure DevOps-supported browser](/azure/devops/server/compatibility).
- **Set up an Azure DevOps organization:** If you don't already have an Azure DevOps organization that you can use for this lab, create one by following the instructions available at [Create an organization or project collection](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization).
- Identify an existing Azure subscription or create a new one.
- Verify that you have a Microsoft account or an Entra account with the Contributor or the Owner role in the Azure subscription. For details, refer to [List Azure role assignments using the Azure portal](/azure/active-directory/roles/manage-roles-portal).

## Exercises

During this lab, you'll complete the following exercises:

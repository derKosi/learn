Post-deployment availability monitoring ensures continuous application accessibility and performance validation through automated testing mechanisms.

Application health verification requires systematic monitoring to detect service degradation, connection failures, and performance anomalies.

Health endpoints provide standardized interfaces for automated monitoring systems. These endpoints range from simple HTTP status responses to comprehensive system validation that exercises critical application components.

Database connectivity validation through health endpoints enables simultaneous verification of application accessibility and backend system integration, providing comprehensive system health assessment.

Availability testing implementation offers two approaches: custom framework development for ping tests or leveraging managed platform services for comprehensive monitoring.

Azure Application Insights provides native availability testing capabilities that integrate seamlessly with deployment pipelines and release gate configurations.

Azure availability tests support any publicly accessible HTTP or HTTPS endpoint without requiring application modifications or instrumentation code.

External service dependency monitoring enables validation of third-party REST APIs and services critical to application functionality, extending availability coverage beyond internal systems.

Azure availability testing supports two distinct test types:

- **URL ping test:** Simple endpoint validation through Azure portal configuration, verifying URL accessibility and HTTP response status codes.
- **Multi-step web test:** Complex scenario validation executing sequential HTTP requests to simulate user workflows and business processes.

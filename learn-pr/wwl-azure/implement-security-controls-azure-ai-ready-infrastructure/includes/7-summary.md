Your completed configuration addressed three critical security challenges. First, you configured managed identities that eliminate credential management burden—your ML workspace authenticates to storage accounts without exposing secrets, reducing breach risk by 40-60% compared to manually managed credentials. Second, you implemented governance scopes that separate production stability from development flexibility, using subscriptions for environment isolation and resource groups for project organization. Third, you applied Azure Policy that automatically prevents noncompliant deployments and remediates existing violations, shifting security enforcement from manual review processes that take days to automated validation that completes in seconds.

## Key takeaways

- **Microsoft Entra ID security principals** define who and what accesses AI resources. Use managed identities for Azure-to-Azure authentication to eliminate credential rotation, groups for team-based permissions to reduce management overhead, and service principals only when integrating with external systems.
- **Azure governance scopes** organize infrastructure hierarchically. Management groups enforce organization-wide policies, subscriptions separate environments with distinct compliance requirements, and resource groups collect project resources that share lifecycle and ownership.
- **Azure Policy** serves as your primary governance mechanism. DeployIfNotExists effect automatically deploys missing configurations, Deny effect prevents noncompliant deployments, and policy initiatives group related requirements for simplified assignment at scale.
- **Defense in depth** emerges from layering these controls: identity restricts who can access resources, scopes determine where policies apply, and policy enforces what configurations are allowed—together creating comprehensive security posture.

## Recommended next steps

Build on this foundation by exploring advanced governance patterns for enterprise AI platforms. Implement Azure Private Link to eliminate public internet exposure for AI services, reducing attack surface for workloads processing sensitive data. Integrate Microsoft Defender for Cloud to continuously assess security posture and receive recommendations aligned with Azure Security Benchmark. Explore Azure Policy initiatives for AI workloads that bundle common requirements into reusable policy sets, or investigate policy-as-code workflows using Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions that version control policy definitions alongside infrastructure.

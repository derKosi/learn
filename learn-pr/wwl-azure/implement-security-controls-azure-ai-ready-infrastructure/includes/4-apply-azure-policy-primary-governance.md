You've established security principals and organized resources into logical scopes. Now you need mechanisms that *automatically enforce* your governance requirements rather than relying on manual reviews. Azure Policy serves as your primary control plane, continuously evaluating resource configurations against your organizational standards. Unlike reactive security reviews that discover problems after deployment, Azure Policy prevents noncompliant resources from being created in the first place—or automatically remediates existing violations without human intervention.

Azure Policy operates through a three-stage workflow. First, you define or select a policy that describes your requirement—for example, "All Azure Machine Learning workspaces must have diagnostic logging enabled." Second, you assign this policy to a scope (management group, subscription, or resource group), determining where the requirement applies. Third, Azure continuously evaluates every resource within that scope, marking it as compliant or noncompliant and triggering enforcement actions based on the policy effect you specified. This evaluation happens automatically whenever resources are created, modified, or when scheduled scans run every 24 hours. The result: your compliance state stays current without requiring your operations team to manually audit hundreds of resources.

With this foundation in place, consider how policy enforcement differs from traditional change approval processes. Traditional approaches require architects to review deployment requests, verify configurations meet standards, and reject noncompliant changes—a process that creates bottlenecks and slows innovation. Azure Policy shifts this responsibility to automation: define your requirements once in policy definitions, and Azure enforces them consistently across every deployment. Your data science team submits a deployment request for a new ML workspace without waiting for security review. If the workspace configuration violates policies (for example, missing required tags or enabled public network access), Azure immediately blocks the deployment with a clear error message explaining which policy was violated and how to fix it. This approach reduces deployment review time from days to minutes while improving compliance consistency from 75-85% (manual review) to 98-100% (automated enforcement).

## Selecting appropriate policy effects for governance requirements

Building on this concept, Azure Policy offers four primary effects that determine *how* policies enforce your requirements, each suited to different governance scenarios. The Audit effect monitors compliance without blocking deployments—useful when you're first implementing governance and need visibility into current violations before enforcing changes. The Deny effect prevents creation of noncompliant resources entirely—your strongest control for critical security requirements. The DeployIfNotExists effect automatically adds missing configurations to resources, remediating violations without requiring manual intervention. The Modify effect changes resource properties during deployment or through remediation tasks—similar to DeployIfNotExists but focused on property modification rather than adding child resources.

For example, suppose your security team mandates that all Azure Storage accounts used by AI workloads must disable public network access to prevent data exfiltration. You could implement this requirement three ways, each using a different policy effect. An Audit policy logs every storage account with public access enabled, generating compliance reports for security reviews but allowing noncompliant accounts to continue operating—appropriate during a grace period while teams migrate existing resources. A Deny policy blocks creation of any new storage account with public access enabled, preventing future violations but requiring manual remediation of existing noncompliant accounts—your choice for enforcing the requirement going forward. A Modify policy automatically sets "publicNetworkAccess: Disabled" on every storage account during creation and can remediate existing accounts through a one-select remediation task—the most automated approach that handles both prevention and remediation.

At the same time, you must balance enforcement strictness with operational flexibility. Overly restrictive Deny policies can block legitimate work: if you deny all Azure AI Services deployments to any region except East US and West Europe, your development team in Asia experiences high latency during model training. Consider using Audit policies in development environments to maintain visibility while allowing experimentation, then applying Deny policies in production where compliance violations carry greater risk. This environment-specific policy assignment—enabled by Azure's scope hierarchy—lets you enforce strict controls where they matter most while avoiding unnecessary friction during innovation.

## Implementing policies for AI infrastructure compliance

Now that you understand policy effects, let's explore common policy patterns for AI workloads. Azure provides built-in policies for many AI-specific requirements, eliminating the need to write custom policy definitions from scratch. The policy "Azure Machine Learning workspaces should use private link" ensures your ML infrastructure isn't accessible from the public internet, reducing attack surface. The policy "Azure AI Services accounts should restrict network access" prevents accidental exposure of API keys through public endpoints. The policy "Require a tag and its value on resources" enforces cost allocation tags on all AI resources, ensuring accurate project chargeback. These built-in policies cover 70-80% of the common governance requirements assigned to your AI scopes.

However, this changes when your organization has requirements that built-in policies don't address. Suppose your compliance team mandates that all Azure Machine Learning compute clusters must use specific virtual machine SKUs that meet data processing certifications. No built-in policy enforces this requirement, so you create a custom policy definition using JSON that checks the "vmSize" property of compute clusters and denies deployment if the SKU isn't in your approved list. Custom policies follow the same assignment and evaluation workflow as built-in policies—once defined, you assign them to appropriate scopes and Azure enforces them automatically. Organizations with mature AI governance platforms typically use 60-70% built-in policies and 30-40% custom policies that address industry-specific or regulatory requirements unique to their environment.

## Monitoring compliance and executing remediation workflows

Building on this foundation, Azure Policy provides compliance dashboards that answer the critical question: *Are my AI resources compliant right now?* The Azure portal's Policy compliance view displays your overall compliance percentage, lists noncompliant resources with specific policy violations, and enables bulk remediation. When you implement a new policy, existing resources that violate it appear in the noncompliant list—Azure doesn't automatically modify them because retroactive enforcement could break running workloads. Instead, you review the violations and initiate remediation tasks that bring existing resources into compliance during planned maintenance windows.

For example, suppose you assign a new DeployIfNotExists policy requiring diagnostic logging on all ML workspaces. Your compliance dashboard immediately shows 12 of 15 workspaces are noncompliant because they lack diagnostic settings. You select these 12 workspaces, select "Create remediation task," and Azure automatically deploys the missing diagnostic configurations over the next 30 minutes. This remediation pattern—policy-driven automated fixing of existing violations—eliminates the manual configuration work that would otherwise require your operations team to update each workspace individually. Organizations report 85-95% reduction in remediation time compared to manual approaches, with the added benefit of perfect consistency across all remediated resources.

This becomes especially important when integrated with Microsoft Defender for Cloud. Defender evaluates your AI resources against security benchmarks and displays findings in the same dashboard as Azure Policy compliance. A finding like "ML workspace has public network access enabled" links directly to the relevant policy assignment, letting you see which policy would prevent this issue and providing a "Remediate" button that fixes the violation immediately. This integration creates a closed-loop governance system: Defender identifies security gaps, Policy prevents future occurrences, and remediation workflows fix existing violations—all without requiring your security team to file tickets or manually update configurations.

## Organizing policies through initiatives for scalable governance

As your policy library grows from a handful of requirements to dozens or hundreds, managing individual policy assignments becomes impractical. Azure Policy initiatives (also called policy sets) group related policies into collections that you assign as a single unit. Microsoft provides built-in initiatives like "Azure Security Benchmark" that contain 200+ policies covering identity, networking, data protection, and more—you assign this initiative once at your management group scope and all member policies apply automatically. Custom initiatives let you create your own policy collections: an "AI Platform Security Baseline" initiative might contain 15-20 policies specific to ML workspaces, AI Services, and supporting infrastructure, ensuring consistent governance across all AI projects.

In practice, this means starting with broad initiatives at high scopes (management group or subscription) that establish your security baseline, then adding specific policy assignments at lower scopes (resource groups) for project-specific requirements. Your management group has the Azure Security Benchmark initiative assigned, ensuring all AI resources meet fundamental security controls. Your production subscription adds a custom "Production AI Governance" initiative requiring more controls like mandatory tagging, approved compute SKUs, and private endpoints. Individual resource groups add policies that reflect their data sensitivity: the fraud detection project resource group includes PCI-specific policies that don't apply to lower-sensitivity projects. This layered approach—general to specific as you move down the scope hierarchy—provides comprehensive coverage without overwhelming teams with hundreds of irrelevant policies.

Building on this foundation, policy exemptions handle legitimate exceptions to governance rules. Suppose your standard policy denies deployment of Azure AI Services in regions outside East US and West Europe for data residency compliance, but one project has explicit customer approval to process data in Japan East due to contractual requirements. Rather than modifying the organization-wide policy (which would weaken controls for everyone), you create a policy exemption for just the Japan East AI Services instance. The exemption documents why the exception was granted, when it expires, and who approved it—maintaining governance visibility while enabling necessary flexibility. Policy exemptions should remain rare (less than 5% of resources) and time-limited to prevent policy drift where exceptions gradually become the norm.

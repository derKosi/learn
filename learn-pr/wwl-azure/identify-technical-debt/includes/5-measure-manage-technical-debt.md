To maintain healthy code quality, include technical debt assessment in your Continuous Integration and Deployment pipelines. This helps you catch issues early and track progress over time.

### Set up automated quality checks

Here's how to integrate quality tools like SonarCloud into your Azure Pipelines:

1. Add SonarCloud to your pipeline configuration
2. Configure quality gates and thresholds
3. Set up automated builds to run quality analysis
4. Review results after each build

When you run your first analysis, you'll see a dashboard showing:

### Take action on findings

Click on any issue category to see specific problems and how to fix them:

Each issue includes:

- Clear description of the problem
- Step-by-step fix instructions
- Time estimate for the repair
- Priority level for planning

### Create a debt management strategy

1. **Set quality gates**: Define minimum standards for code to pass
2. **Prioritize fixes**: Address high-impact issues first
3. **Track progress**: Monitor debt trends over time
4. **Allocate time**: Reserve time in each sprint for debt reduction

This module shows you how to configure Microsoft Foundry hubs across multiple regions, implement geo-redundant storage with soft delete protection for training datasets, and deploy Azure Container Registry with automatic image replication. By the end, you'll architect production-ready AI infrastructure that maintains availability during regional failures and protects critical data assets.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you are able to:

- Configure Microsoft Foundry hubs for multi-region AI workload distribution
- Implement geo-redundant Azure Blob Storage with soft delete and resource locks for AI data protection
- Deploy Azure Container Registry Premium with geo-replication for AI model distribution
- Evaluate infrastructure resilience strategies for enterprise AI workloads

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Experience managing Azure resources through the Azure portal or Azure CLI
- Familiarity with Azure resource groups, regions, and basic networking concepts
- Understanding of AI/ML lifecycle including model training, deployment, and inference

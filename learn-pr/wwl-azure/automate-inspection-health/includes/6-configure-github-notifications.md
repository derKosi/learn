GitHub notifications deliver real-time updates for subscribed activities through a centralized inbox system that supports customization, triage workflows, and comprehensive update management.

Notification subscription options provide granular control over communication preferences:

- **Conversation-specific monitoring:** Targeted alerts for individual issues, pull requests, or gist discussions.
- **Repository-wide surveillance:** Comprehensive activity monitoring for entire repositories or team discussions.
- **CI/CD workflow integration:** Automated status updates for GitHub Actions workflows and pipeline execution.
- **Repository lifecycle events:** Issues, pull requests, releases, security alerts, and discussion notifications (when enabled).

By default, you automatically watch all repositories you create and own by your personal account and subscribe to conversations when you have:

- Not disabled automatic watching for repositories or teams you've joined in your notification settings.
- Been assigned to an issue or pull request.
- Opened a pull request, issue, or created a team discussion post.
- Commented on a thread.
- Subscribed to a thread manually by clicking Watch or Subscribe.
- Had your username @mentioned.
- Changed the thread's state by closing an issue or merging a pull request.
- Had a team you're a member of @mentioned.

> [!TIP]
> To unsubscribe from conversations, you can change your notification settings or directly unsubscribe or unwatch activity on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Managing your subscriptions](https://docs.github.com/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/managing-your-subscriptions)."

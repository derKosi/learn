GitOps is a software delivery approach using Git repositories as the single source of truth for infrastructure, configuration, and application code management. GitOps release strategies implement all system changes through Git commits and pull requests, including infrastructure provisioning, configuration updates, and application deployments. Core GitOps principles encompass declarative configuration, version control, automation, and continuous delivery.

## Defining a comprehensive GitOps release strategy

Comprehensive GitOps strategy implementation requires the following considerations:

- **Declarative configuration**: Express desired system state through declarative configuration files using tools such as PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) or Ansible. Configuration files define system behavior including environment variables, application settings, and service configurations.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Define infrastructure components declaratively using tools such as Bicep and Azure Resource Manager templates.
- **Version control**: Store configuration files, infrastructure definitions, and application code in Git repositories for versioning, change tracking, and team collaboration. Implement branching strategies and pull requests for change management and code review enforcement.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Implement continuous deployment pipelines that automatically deploy changes to the system based on Git commits and pull requests. CI/CD services such as Azure Pipelines or GitHub Actions trigger pipeline executions in response to Git events, such as code merges or branch updates.
- **Automated synchronization**: Deployments are triggered automatically whenever changes are pushed to the Git repository. GitOps tools such as Flux or Argo CD continuously monitor Git repositories for changes and synchronize the desired state of the system with the configuration stored in Git.
- **Immutable infrastructure**: Adopt an immutable infrastructure approach where infrastructure components and application containers are treated as disposable artifacts. Each deployment creates a new immutable instance of the system, reducing configuration drift and ensuring consistency across environments.
- **Rollback and recovery**: Implement Git-based workflows for rollback and recovery procedures during deployment failures. Git repository reverts trigger automatic rollback actions in CI/CD pipelines, restoring systems to previous stable states.
- **Observability and Monitoring**: Implement monitoring, logging, and observability practices to track system health, performance metrics, and deployment status. Integrate monitoring tools such as Azure Monitor, Prometheus, or Grafana with GitOps workflows to gain visibility into system behavior and detect anomalies in real-time.

Release pipelines and stages utilize triggers to initiate deployment processes. Three primary trigger types control release automation.

## Continuous deployment trigger

Continuous deployment triggers automatically initiate releases when build completion creates new artifacts. This trigger enables immediate deployment upon successful build completion.

## Scheduled triggers

Scheduled triggers enable time-based release automation. Configure specific times for release initiation, such as daily deployments at 3:00 AM or 12:00 PM. Multiple daily schedules can be configured to run at predetermined intervals.

## Manual trigger

Manual triggers require explicit human or system intervention to initiate releases. Users can start releases through the interface, while automated systems can trigger releases through API calls or automation engines integrated with release management tools.

Quality gates enforce organizational quality policies and determine production readiness through automated validation criteria.

Quality gates are positioned before stages that depend on previous stage outcomes. Traditional quality assurance departments monitored these gates manually using documentation and guidelines to verify software quality standards before progression.

Continuous Delivery identifies manual processes as potential bottlenecks requiring automation.

Quality gates must evolve from manual validation to automated pipeline checks that maintain quality standards without human intervention.

Automated release gates validate organizational policies and enable seamless pipeline progression based on predefined criteria.

Common quality gate implementations include:

- Zero new blocker issues
- Code coverage exceeding 80% on new code
- No license violations detected
- No dependency vulnerabilities identified
- Technical debt metrics maintained or improved
- Performance benchmarks preserved post-release
- Compliance validations:
  - Work item linkage verification
  - Segregation of duties validation (different committer and releaser)

Quality gate implementation enhances release reliability and should be integrated into all deployment pipelines.

Externalized configuration architectures from source control establish clear responsibility delineation across configuration management stakeholders.

Role-based configuration management defines distinct responsibilities:

- **Configuration custodian:** Operations and security engineering teams responsible for configuration value lifecycle management encompassing CRUD operations on keys, secret security assurance, key and token regeneration, and environment-specific setting definitions including log level specifications. Configuration injection occurs through CI/CD pipeline implementations. Custodians manage configuration governance without defining application-specific configuration schemas.

- **Configuration consumer:** Development and testing teams defining configuration schema requirements and consuming configuration values within application and library code implementations. Consumers focus on configuration capability requirements rather than environment-specific values. Developers specify connection string requirements without knowledge of production credential values across deployment environments.

- **Configuration store:** Underlying persistence infrastructure storing non-sensitive configuration data. While simple file-based implementations suffice for basic scenarios, distributed applications require reliable cross-environment stores. Configuration stores persist environment-specific behavioral parameters excluding sensitive data requiring encryption or Hardware Security Module (HSM) protection.

- **Secret store:** Dedicated secure storage infrastructure for sensitive configuration data maintaining separation from general configuration stores. Secret stores provide secure channels for connection strings, credentials, certificates, and authentication tokens. Architectural segregation enables operations team centralized secret management while minimizing security exposure if configuration stores experience compromise.

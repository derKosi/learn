This module introduces you to **continuous feedback practices** and **monitoring tools** essential for tracking application usage and flow. Learn how to implement **Azure Monitor**, **Log Analytics**, and **Application Insights** to gain deep insights into application performance, user behavior, and system health. Explore **Kusto Query Language (KQL)** for powerful data analysis.

## Why continuous monitoring matters

In modern DevOps practices, **continuous monitoring** is crucial for:

- **Early issue detection:** Identify problems before they impact users
- **Performance optimization:** Track metrics to improve application responsiveness
- **User experience insights:** Understand how users interact with your applications
- **Data-driven decisions:** Make informed choices based on real telemetry data
- **Proactive alerting:** Receive notifications when thresholds are exceeded
- **Cost optimization:** Monitor resource usage to control cloud spending

## What you'll learn

This module covers the complete **monitoring and observability** stack in Azure:

### Azure Monitor and Log Analytics

- **Centralized monitoring:** Single platform for all telemetry data
- **Log collection:** Gather logs from applications, infrastructure, and services
- **Metrics visualization:** Create dashboards and charts for real-time insights
- **Advanced analytics:** Use powerful query capabilities to analyze data

### Application Insights

- **Application Performance Monitoring (APM):** Track request rates, response times, and failure rates
- **Dependency tracking:** Monitor calls to databases, APIs, and external services
- **Exception monitoring:** Capture and analyze application exceptions
- **Live metrics:** View real-time telemetry as requests flow through your application
- **Usage analytics:** Understand user behavior and feature adoption

### Kusto Query Language (KQL)

- **Powerful queries:** Analyze large volumes of telemetry data efficiently
- **Data exploration:** Discover patterns and anomalies in your data
- **Custom metrics:** Create calculated fields and aggregations
- **Visualization:** Generate charts and tables from query results

### Inner loop and outer loop

- **Inner loop:** Fast feedback during local development
- **Outer loop:** Comprehensive monitoring in production environments
- **Feedback integration:** Route insights back to development teams

By implementing **Application Insights** and **Azure Monitor**, you can:

- **Collect telemetry:** Automatically capture requests, dependencies, and exceptions
- **Analyze with KQL:** Query logs to identify slow database queries
- **Visualize performance:** Create dashboards showing response times by endpoint
- **Set alerts:** Configure notifications when error rates exceed thresholds
- **Optimize code:** Use insights to improve slow-performing code paths

This module teaches you how to implement these monitoring capabilities effectively.

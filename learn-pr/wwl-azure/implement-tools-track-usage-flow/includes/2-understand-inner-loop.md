The **inner loop** is a fundamental concept in software development that significantly impacts developer productivity and feedback cycles. Understanding and optimizing the inner loop is crucial for efficient DevOps practices and continuous improvement.

## What is the inner loop?

The **inner loop** is the **iterative process** that a developer performs when writing, building, and debugging code. It represents the **rapid feedback cycle** that happens locally on a developer's machine before code is shared with the team or deployed to production.

### Key characteristics

- **Local execution:** Runs entirely on the developer's workstation
- **Fast iteration:** Designed for quick feedback and rapid changes
- **Frequent repetition:** Executed many times per day during active development
- **Individual focus:** Optimized for single-developer productivity
- **Pre-commit activities:** Happens before code enters version control

Many development teams recognize the inner loop as something they want to keep **as short as possible** because faster feedback leads to higher productivity and better code quality.

## Inner loop variations by technology

The **specific activities** in a developer's inner loop depend significantly on:

- **Technologies used:** Programming languages, frameworks, and runtime environments
- **Tools available:** IDEs, build systems, and testing frameworks
- **Developer preferences:** Individual workflow optimizations and habits
- **Project type:** Web applications, libraries, microservices, or mobile apps

### Example: Library development inner loop

For **library development**, a typical inner loop includes:

1. **Coding:** Write or modify library code
2. **Building:** Compile the library
3. **Testing:** Run unit tests to verify functionality
4. **Debugging:** Fix issues discovered during testing
5. **Committing:** Save changes to local Git repository

### Example: Web front-end development inner loop

For **web front-end work**, the inner loop is optimized differently:

1. **Coding:** Edit HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
2. **Bundling:** Run build tools (Webpack, Vite, etc.)
3. **Refreshing:** Reload browser to see changes
4. **Debugging:** Use browser DevTools to inspect behavior
5. **Committing:** Save changes to local Git repository

### Contextual switching

Most **modern codebases** comprise multiple components, so a developer's inner loop may **alternate** depending on what is being worked on:

- **Backend API:** Focus on code, build, test, debug
- **Frontend UI:** Focus on code, bundle, refresh, inspect
- **Database schema:** Focus on migrations, testing, rollback
- **Infrastructure:** Focus on configuration, deployment, validation

## Categorizing inner loop activities

The steps within the inner loop can be grouped into **three broad activity categories**:

### 1. Experimentation

**Activities that add customer value:**

- **Coding:** Writing new features or fixing bugs
- **Designing:** Planning architecture or user interfaces
- **Prototyping:** Exploring new approaches or solutions

**Characteristic:** These activities are the **only ones** that directly add value to the end product.

### 2. Feedback collection

**Activities that verify quality:**

- **Building:** Compiling code to verify syntax and dependencies
- **Testing:** Running unit tests to validate functionality
- **Debugging:** Identifying and fixing issues
- **Code analysis:** Running linters and static analyzers

**Characteristic:** These activities **don't add value directly** but provide **essential feedback** to ensure code quality and correctness.

### 3. Tax

**Activities that are necessary but don't add value or feedback:**

- **Committing:** Saving code to version control
- **Configuration:** Setting up build environments
- **Synchronization:** Pulling latest changes from remote repositories
- **Documentation updates:** Updating README files or comments

**Characteristic:** These activities are **necessary work** but neither add customer value nor provide feedback. If an activity is **unnecessary**, it's waste and should be eliminated.

### Example categorization: Library development

For the library development scenario:

| **Activity**        | **Category**        | **Purpose**                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Coding              | Experimentation     | Adds customer value         |
| Building            | Feedback Collection | Verifies code compiles      |
| Testing / Debugging | Feedback Collection | Validates functionality     |
| Committing          | Tax                 | Necessary but adds no value |

> [!NOTE]
> Putting **committing** in the tax category may seem harsh, but the categorization helps identify activities that should be **minimized** or **deferred** until absolutely necessary.

## Optimizing the inner loop

Having categorized the steps within the loop, it's now possible to establish **optimization principles**:

### Core optimization principles

**1. Speed is proportional to change**

- **Goal:** Execute the loop as fast as possible
- **Principle:** Total execution time should be proportional to the size of changes made
- **Benefit:** Small changes get quick feedback; large changes take appropriately longer

**2. Maximize feedback quality, minimize feedback time**

- **Goal:** Get the most useful information in the shortest time
- **Principle:** Balance between comprehensive testing and rapid iteration
- **Benefit:** Catch critical issues quickly while deferring less critical checks

**3. Minimize or defer tax**

- **Goal:** Reduce unnecessary overhead
- **Principle:** Eliminate waste and defer non-critical activities
- **Example:** Defer documentation updates until commit time

**4. Combat complexity growth**

- **Challenge:** As codebases grow, inner loops naturally slow down
- **Reason:** More code means more tests, dependencies, and build time
- **Impact:** Even small changes require disproportionate feedback collection time

### The monolithic codebase problem

In **large monolithic codebases**, you can encounter situations where:

- **Small change:** Modify one function
- **Disproportionate cost:** Wait 10+ minutes for full build and test suite
- **Developer frustration:** Productivity plummets as feedback cycles slow
- **Context switching:** Developers lose focus waiting for builds

**This is a problem you must address proactively.**

## Strategies for large codebase optimization

Teams can employ several strategies to optimize the inner loop for larger codebases:

### 1. Incremental builds and tests

**Only build and test what changed:**

- **Smart build systems:** Detect changed files and rebuild only affected components
- **Test selection:** Run only tests affected by code changes
- **Dependency tracking:** Understand which tests depend on which code
- **Tools:** Use build systems like Bazel, Buck, or Gradle with smart incremental builds

**Benefits:**

- Dramatically reduced build times for small changes
- Proportional feedback time to change size
- Faster iteration cycles

### 2. Caching intermediate results

**Cache build artifacts to speed up complete builds:**

- **Local caching:** Store compiled objects and test results locally
- **Distributed caching:** Share build artifacts across team members
- **Remote execution:** Offload compilation to cloud build farms
- **Tools:** Implement caching with systems like ccache, sccache, or cloud-based solutions

**Benefits:**

- Avoid redundant compilation of unchanged code
- Faster clean builds after branch switches
- Reduced CI/CD pipeline execution time

### 3. Modularization and binary sharing

**Break up the codebase into small units and share binaries:**

- **Extract libraries:** Pull common functionality into separate packages
- **Define boundaries:** Create clear module interfaces and dependencies
- **Version packages:** Publish stable versions of internal libraries
- **Manage dependencies:** Use package managers to consume stable versions

**Caution:** This strategy can be a **double-edged sword** if done incorrectly (see Tangled Loops section below).

**Benefits when done right:**

- Smaller compilation units
- Independent versioning and deployment
- Clearer architectural boundaries
- Reusable components across projects

**Risks when done wrong:**

- Tangled dependencies requiring changes across multiple repositories
- Increased tax due to outer loop overhead
- Version mismatch problems

## Understanding tangled loops

The concept of **tangled loops** illustrates what happens when modularization is done incorrectly, causing inner and outer loops to become entangled.

### The outer loop

Before understanding tangled loops, we need to define the **outer loop**:

**Outer loop characteristics:**

- **Team collaboration:** Code is shared with the team through pull requests
- **Quality gates:** Code reviews, automated scans, security checks
- **Integration:** Code is merged into main branch and deployed
- **Higher tax:** More overhead due to collaboration and automation
- **Slower feedback:** Minutes to hours instead of seconds to minutes

:::image type="content" source="../media/outer-loop-09b3065e.png" alt-text="Diagram showing code, build, test and commit in the Outer Loop.":::

### The modularization scenario

Consider this common scenario:

**Initial state:** A monolithic application with an **application-specific framework** that does heavy lifting.

**Modularization decision:** Extract the framework into a **separate package**.

**Implementation steps:**

1. **Pull code into separate repository:** Framework code moves to its own repo
2. **Set up CI/CD pipeline:** Automated build and publish for framework package
3. **Add quality gates:** Pull request reviews, security scans, approval workflows
4. **Publish as package:** Framework becomes a versioned dependency

**Initial result:** Things work well initially. The monolith consumes stable framework versions.

### When tangling occurs

**Problem scenario:** You need to develop a **new feature** that requires **extensive new capabilities** in the framework.

**The pain point:** You must now **co-evolve code** in two separate repositories with a binary dependency between them.

**What happens:**

1. **Add method to framework:** Create new capability in framework repo
2. **Go through outer loop:** Code review, tests, security scans, approval
3. **Wait for package publish:** Framework package must be built and published
4. **Update application:** Modify application to use new framework method
5. **Repeat:** Every iteration requires full outer loop cycle

**The problem:** The original codebase's **inner loop** now **includes the outer loop** of the framework code.

### Outer loop tax

The **outer loop includes significant tax**:

- **Code reviews:** Wait for reviewers to provide feedback
- **Security scanning:** Automated vulnerability and compliance checks
- **Binary signing:** Certificate-based signing for published packages
- **Release pipelines:** Deployment automation and testing
- **Approval gates:** Manual approvals for production releases

**Impact:** You **don't want to pay this tax** every time you add a method to a class and want to use it immediately.

### Developer workarounds

What typically happens:

**Local hacks:** Developers create workarounds to stitch inner loops together:

- **Local package references:** Point to local filesystem instead of published package
- **Git submodules:** Include framework source directly in application
- **Sym links:** Create links between repositories
- **Pre-release packages:** Publish to test feeds

**Consequence:** These workarounds get **messy quickly** and still require paying outer loop tax eventually.

### The right way to modularize

**Modularization isn't inherently bad** - it can work brilliantly when done correctly:

**Good modularization:**

- **Stable interfaces:** Framework APIs change infrequently
- **Independent evolution:** Framework and application evolve separately
- **Clear boundaries:** Well-defined responsibilities and contracts
- **Loose coupling:** Minimal dependencies between components

**Bad modularization:**

- **Tight coupling:** Framework and application must change together
- **Frequent co-evolution:** Every feature requires framework changes
- **Unclear boundaries:** Responsibilities overlap between components
- **Artificial separation:** Split made for organizational, not technical reasons

**Key principle:** Make modularization **incisions carefully** based on actual architectural boundaries, not organizational structure.

## Best practices for inner loop optimization

### Monitor and measure

**Track inner loop metrics:**

- **Build time:** How long does compilation take?
- **Test execution time:** How long do tests run?
- **Feedback delay:** Time from save to seeing results
- **Developer satisfaction:** Survey team about pain points

**Tools for measurement:**

- Build system analytics
- IDE performance profilers
- Test execution reports
- Developer productivity surveys

### Address slowdowns proactively

**Warning signs:**

- Developers complain about slow builds
- Context switching increases during build waits
- Team starts skipping tests locally
- Pull requests include "untested" code

**Response strategies:**

- Investigate root causes immediately
- Prioritize optimization work
- Involve entire team in solutions
- Measure improvements over time

### Balance trade-offs

**Key trade-offs to consider:**

| **Optimization**   | **Benefit**               | **Cost**                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Incremental builds | Faster local builds       | Complex build configuration  |
| Build caching      | Faster clean builds       | Storage and network overhead |
| Modularization     | Smaller compilation units | Potential tangled loops      |
| Fewer tests        | Faster feedback           | Reduced confidence           |
| Parallel execution | Faster overall time       | Higher resource usage        |

**Principle:** Improving one aspect **will often cause issues** in another. Continuously evaluate trade-offs.

### Team alignment

**Shared responsibility:**

- **Architects:** Design for testability and modularity
- **Developers:** Write efficient tests and avoid unnecessary dependencies
- **DevOps:** Provide build infrastructure and caching
- **Management:** Prioritize inner loop optimization work

**Cultural practices:**

- Treat inner loop time as a key productivity metric
- Make "slow build" a valid reason to pause feature work
- Celebrate inner loop improvements
- Share optimization knowledge across teams

## Key takeaways

**Remember these principles:**

1. **No silver bullet:** There's no universal solution for inner loop optimization
2. **Understand the problem:** Identify when slowdowns occur and their root causes
3. **Measure everything:** Track metrics to understand impact of changes
4. **Act proactively:** Address issues before they severely impact productivity
5. **Balance trade-offs:** Every optimization has costs; choose wisely
6. **Modularize carefully:** Split codebases based on technical boundaries, not convenience
7. **Continuous improvement:** Inner loop optimization is ongoing work

**Architecture matters:** Decisions about how you **build**, **test**, and **debug** your applications will significantly impact developer productivity and happiness. Invest time in getting these fundamentals right.

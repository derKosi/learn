Successful software delivery depends on a branching strategy that balances speed, quality, and risk management. The goal is to ship enhancements quickly while maintaining production stability.

### Strategic Balance: Speed vs. Quality

An effective branching model must strike the right balance:

- **Minimize process overhead** to accelerate time-to-market.
- **Maintain quality gates** to prevent defects from reaching production.
- **Enable parallel development** for team scalability.
- **Support rapid hotfix deployment** for critical issues.

While numerous Git branching strategies exist, the most effective approach combines proven patterns with your team's specific needs. Modern enterprise teams typically adopt a **lightweight, trunk-based development model** centered on feature branches and pull requests.

### Core Principle: Always-Ready Main Branch

This unit teaches you to implement a continuous delivery-ready branching model using feature branches and pull requests to maintain a consistently deployable main branch.

## Enterprise Branching Strategy Framework

The following principles establish a robust foundation for continuous delivery:

### Main Branch Stability

- **Single source of truth**: The main branch is the exclusive path for production releases.
- **Production readiness**: Main branch must always be in a deployable state.
- **Branch protection**: Implement comprehensive branch policies to prevent direct commits.
- **Gated changes**: All modifications flow through pull requests exclusively.
- **Release tracking**: Tag all production releases with semantic Git tags.

### Feature Branch Discipline

- **Isolated development**: Create dedicated branches for all features and bug fixes.
- **Feature flag integration**: Manage long-running features with feature toggles to reduce branch lifetime.
- **Strategic naming**: Use descriptive naming conventions that reflect business value.
- **Pull request workflow**: Merge to main exclusively through reviewed pull requests.

### Release Branch Strategy

- **Dedicated preparation**: Create release branches from stable feature integration points.
- **Quality assurance**: Conduct thorough testing and stabilization on release branches.
- **Production hardening**: Apply final bug fixes and performance optimizations.
- **Milestone tracking**: Tag significant release milestones for traceability.

### Naming Conventions for Scale

```bash
# Bug fixes
bugfix/[ticket-id]-description
bugfix/AUTH-123-login-timeout

# Feature development
features/[area]/[feature-name]
features/authentication/oauth-integration
features/api/rate-limiting

# Hotfixes
hotfix/[severity]-description
hotfix/critical-payment-gateway

# Personal branches
users/[username]/[description]
users/john-doe/experimental-caching
```

### Pull Request Management

- **Mandatory code review**: No exceptions for direct merges to main.
- **Automated validation**: Integrate CI/CD pipelines for quality gates.
- **Performance metrics**: Track and optimize pull request completion time.
- **Knowledge sharing**: Use reviews for team learning and standards enforcement.

## Prerequisites and Setup

### Essential Tools for Enterprise Git Workflows

This practical exercise leverages Azure's comprehensive DevOps toolchain:

- **[Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)**: Cloud-native command-line interface for Azure services.
- **[Azure DevOps CLI](/azure/devops/cli)**: Specialized extension for seamless Git, CI/CD, and Agile tool integration across Windows, Linux, and macOS.

### Azure DevOps CLI Configuration

The Azure DevOps CLI provides flexible output formatting (JSON, YAML, table, TSV) to support various automation scenarios. Configure your preferred format using:

```bash
az devops configure --defaults output=table
```

## Hands-On Implementation: Enterprise Git Workflow

This comprehensive walkthrough demonstrates enterprise-grade Git branching for continuous delivery, covering feature development, hotfix deployment, and conflict resolution.

### Step 1: Feature Branch Creation and Development

Create a feature branch following enterprise naming conventions:

**_myWebApp_**

```bash
git checkout -b feature/myFeature-1
```

**Output:**
_Switched to a new branch 'feature/myFeature-1'._

Verify branch context and working tree status:

**_myWebApp_**

```bash
git branch
```

**Output:**
_âœ“ feature/myFeature-1_

- main\*

### Step 2: Feature Implementation and Version Control

Implement your feature changes:

**_myWebApp_**

```bash
# Edit your source files
code Program.cs  # Or your preferred editor
```

Follow the complete commit lifecycle:

**_myWebApp_**

```bash
git status
```

**Output:**
_On branch feature/myFeature-1_
_Changes not staged for commit:_

- modified: Program.cs\*

**_myWebApp_**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement myFeature-1 with enhanced error handling"
```

**Output:**
_[feature/myFeature-1 70f67b2] feat: implement myFeature-1 with enhanced error handling_
_1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)_

Publish to remote repository:

**_myWebApp_**

```bash
git push -u origin feature/myFeature-1
```

**Output:**
_To https://dev.azure.com/organization/teamproject/_git/MyWebApp_

- _[new branch] feature/myFeature-1 -> feature/myFeature-1_
  _Branch feature/myFeature-1 set up to track remote branch feature/myFeature-1 from origin._

### Step 3: Azure DevOps CLI Configuration and Pull Request Creation

Configure Azure DevOps CLI for your organization and project. Replace **organization** and **project name**:

```CMD
az devops configure --defaults organization=https://dev.azure.com/organization project="project name"
```

Create a new pull request (using the Azure DevOps CLI) to review the changes in the feature-1 branch:

```CMD
az repos pr create --title "Review Feature-1 before merging to main" --work-items 38 39 `
--description "#Merge feature-1 to main" `
--source-branch feature/myFeature-1 --target-branch main `
--repository myWebApp --open
```

Use the --open switch when raising the pull request to open it in a web browser after it has been created. The --deletesource-branch switch can be used to delete the branch after the pull request is complete. Also, consider using --auto-complete to complete automatically when all policies have passed, and the source branch can be merged into the target branch.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about **az repos pr create** parameter, see [Create a pull request to review and merge code](/azure/devops/repos/git/pull-requests).

The team jointly reviews the code changes and approves the pull request:

:::image type="content" source="../media/pr-code-changes-approved-completed-90fe3da6.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the pull request with code changes approved and completed.":::

The main is ready to release. Team tags the main branch with the release number:

:::image type="content" source="../media/create-tag-example-9a81a5d0.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the creation of a tag example.":::

### Step 4: Parallel Feature Development

Start work on Feature 2. Create a branch on remote from the main branch and do the checkout locally:

**_myWebApp_**

```CMD
git push origin main:refs/heads/feature/myFeature-2
```

**Output:**
_Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0) To `https://dev.azure.com/**organization**/**teamproject**/\_git/MyWebApp` \* \[new branch\] origin/HEAD -&gt; refs/heads/feature/myFeature-2._

**_myWebApp_**

```CMD
git checkout feature/myFeature-2
```

**Output:**
_Switched to a new branch 'feature/myFeature-2' Branch feature/myFeature-2 set up to track remote branch feature/myFeature-2 from origin._

Modify Program.cs by changing the same comment line in the code changed in feature-1:

    ```
    public class Program
    {
        // Editing the same line (file from feature-2 branch)
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            BuildWebHost(args).Run();
        }

        public static IWebHost BuildWebHost(string[] args) =>
            WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
                .UseStartup<Startup>()
                .Build();
    ```

### Step 5: Feature 2 Pull Request and Hotfix Scenario

Commit the changes locally, push them to the remote repository, and then raise a pull request to merge the changes from feature/myFeature-2 to the main branch:

```CMD
az repos pr create --title "Review Feature-2 before merging to main" --work-items 40 42 `
--description "#Merge feature-2 to main" `
--source-branch feature/myFeature-2 --target-branch main `
--repository myWebApp --open
```

A critical bug is reported in production against the feature-1 release with the pull request in flight. To investigate the issue, you need to debug against the version of the code currently deployed in production. To investigate the issue, create a new fof branch using the release_feature1 tag:

**_myWebApp_**

```CMD
git checkout -b fof/bug-1 release_feature1
```

**Output:**
_Switched to a new branch, 'fof/bug-1'._

### Step 6: Critical Hotfix Implementation

Modify Program.cs by changing the same line of code that was changed in the feature-1 release:

```
public class Program
{
    // Editing the same line (file from feature-FOF branch)
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        BuildWebHost(args).Run();
    }

    public static IWebHost BuildWebHost(string[] args) =>
        WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
            .UseStartup<Startup>()
            .Build();
```

Stage and commit the changes locally, then push changes to the remote repository:

**_myWebApp_**

```CMD
git add .
git commit -m "Adding FOF changes."
git push -u origin fof/bug-1
```

**Output:**
_To `https://dev.azure.com/**organization**/**teamproject**/\_git/MyWebApp` \* \[new branch\] fof/bug-1 - fof/bug-1 Branch fof/bug-1 set up to track remote branch fof/bug-1 from origin._

### Step 7: Hotfix Integration and Conflict Resolution

Immediately after the changes have been rolled out to production, tag the fof\\bug-1 branch with the release_bug-1 tag, then raise a pull request to merge the changes from fof/bug-1 back into the main:

```CMD
az repos pr create --title "Review Bug-1 before merging to main" --work-items 100 `
--description "#Merge Bug-1 to main" `
--source-branch fof/Bug-1 --target-branch main `
--repository myWebApp --open
```

    As part of the pull request, the branch is deleted. However, you can still reference the entire history using the tag.

    With the critical bug fix out of the way, let's review the feature-2 pull request.

    The branches page makes it clear that the feature/myFeature-2 branch is one change ahead of the main and two changes behind the main:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/branches-page-352f877b.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the branches page. The feature myFeature two branches are one change ahead of the main and two changes behind the main.":::

    If you tried to approve the pull request, you'd see an error message informing you of a merge conflict:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/merge-conflicts-pull-request-84cba5e1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of merge conflicts from pull request.":::

## Resolve merge conflicts

To resolve merge conflicts, you can use the Azure DevOps web interface or resolve them locally using Git commands. For local resolution, first update your feature branch with the latest changes from main:

    ```CMD
    git checkout feature/myFeature-2
    git fetch origin
    git merge origin/main
    ```

    Resolve the conflicts in your preferred editor, then complete the merge:

    ```CMD
    git add .
    git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts between feature-2 and main"
    git push origin feature/myFeature-2
    ```

    With the conflicts resolved, the pull request can be completed successfully.

At this point, you can create a release branch based on the critical bug fix implemented in the **fof/bug-1** branch and merged into main. Using the git checkout command, create a dedicated release branch from the main branch.

```CMD
git checkout -b release/v1.1 main
```

This command creates a new branch named release/v1.1 based on the main branch.

As significant milestones are reached during the release process, tag releases in the release branch using Git tags. Tags serve as markers to denote specific versions of the software.

```CMD
git tag -a v1.1 -m "Release version 1.1"
```

This command creates a tag named v1.1 to mark the release version 1.1 in the release branch.

## How it works

We learned how the Git branching model gives you the flexibility to work on features in parallel by creating a branch for each feature.

The pull request workflow allows you to review code changes using the branch policies.

Git tags are a great way to record milestones, such as the version of code released; tags give you a way to create branches from tags.

We created a branch from a previous release tag to fix a critical bug in production.

The branches view in the web portal makes it easy to identify branches ahead of the main. Also, it forces a merge conflict if any ongoing pull requests try to merge to the main without resolving the merge conflicts.

A lean branching model allows you to create short-lived branches and push quality changes to production faster.

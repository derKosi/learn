## Hub provisioning decisions

Before you create your first hub, consider three foundational decisions that determine governance boundaries for all child projects. Start with region selection: choose the Azure region closest to your users to minimize latency and closest to your data sources to reduce egress costs. If your organization operates globally, you'll likely provision multiple hubs—one per region—to satisfy data residency regulations. Organizations typically create resource groups for Production, Staging, and Development environments, making it straightforward to calculate costs per environment and delete entire environments during testing.

The third decision—networking configuration—carries the most security implications. Public access enables rapid prototyping: developers connect from laptops without VPN, and automated CI/CD pipelines deploy models from GitHub Actions. However, production workloads handling customer data usually demand private endpoints that route all traffic through your virtual network. When you select private endpoint mode during hub creation, Azure provisions network interfaces in your specified subnet, blocks public internet access, and requires on-premises users to connect through ExpressRoute or VPN. This configuration satisfies compliance frameworks requiring network isolation but adds complexity: you configure DNS resolution for privatelink.api.azureml.ms hostnames and ensure your corporate firewall allows traffic to Azure services.

At the same time, Azure creates a system-assigned managed identity for your hub. This identity eliminates credential management: instead of storing connection strings or API keys in project code, the hub's managed identity authenticates to connected Azure services like Azure AI Search and Azure Storage. Building on this foundation, the identity receives the Contributor role on the hub's resource group by default, enabling it to provision compute resources and manage child projects. Your security team benefits from centralized identity lifecycle management—rotate credentials by regenerating the managed identity, and Azure Active Directory automatically propagates the new credentials to all connected services within minutes.

## Role-based access control configuration

Now that your hub exists with networking and identity configured, assign Azure RBAC roles to control who can create projects, manage connections, and view activity logs. The Cognitive Services Contributor role grants AI engineers permission to create projects, deploy models, and configure project-level connections without giving them access to modify hub networking or delete the hub itself. Assign this role to your AI development team's Azure AD group, and every team member inherits the same permissions automatically as they join or leave the group.

For example, suppose your compliance team needs read-only visibility into AI infrastructure without the ability to modify resources. Assign the Reader role at the hub scope, and compliance officers can navigate to the hub in Azure portal, review connected resources, examine activity logs showing all administrative actions, and export deployment metadata—all without permission to change configurations. This separation of duties becomes critical during SOC 2 or ISO 27001 audits when you must demonstrate that monitoring personnel can't alter the systems they audit.

With roles assigned, consider custom roles for specialized scenarios. Your finance team might need a custom role that permits viewing cost analysis data and resource tags but denies access to view actual AI models or datasets. Azure RBAC's fine-grained permissions enable you to create a "Cost Analyst" role that includes actions like Microsoft.CostManagement/reports/read and Microsoft.Resources/tags/read while excluding Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/data/read. This becomes especially important when contractual obligations or industry regulations require strict segregation between financial auditors and technical personnel handling sensitive data.

## Project creation and organization patterns

Building on your hub's security foundation, organize projects to reflect how teams actually work. Create one project per AI application or use case: the Customer Support Bot project contains all code, training data, and deployed models for your chatbot initiative, while the Fraud Detection project houses the separate machine learning pipeline analyzing transaction patterns. This one-to-one mapping simplifies ownership—each project has a designated product owner who approves changes—and makes billing transparent through Azure tags.

When creating a project, Azure automatically inherits the parent hub's network configuration, managed identity, and policy assignments. The Support Bot project created in your Production Hub with private endpoints can't accidentally expose data through public internet access—the inheritance model enforces that security boundary. However, projects maintain complete isolation for code repositories, datasets, model registries, and deployment endpoints. Two projects in the same hub can use different machine learning frameworks, deploy models to different compute clusters, and manage separate CI/CD pipelines without interfering with each other.

For example, consider organizational patterns as your AI initiatives scale. Tag projects with metadata that supports cost allocation and lifecycle management: assign CostCenter tags matching your accounting system's department codes, Environment tags (Production, Staging, Development) that drive automated cleanup policies, and DataClassification tags (Public, Internal, Confidential) that trigger security scanning. With these tags in place, finance generates monthly chargeback reports showing each department's AI spending, operations teams use Azure Automation to delete Development-tagged projects older than 90 days, and security teams configure Azure Defender to alert when Confidential-tagged projects attempt to connect to public endpoints.

## Governance at scale through Azure Policy

Now that you understand project organization, examine how Azure Policy enforces standards across all projects within a hub. Assign policies at the hub's resource group scope, and they automatically apply to every project created within that hub. A common baseline includes policies requiring specific tags on all resources, restricting deployment to approved Azure regions, and enforcing encryption at rest with customer-managed keys. When a developer attempts to create a storage account in a project without the required CostCenter tag, Azure blocks the deployment immediately and displays a policy violation message with remediation instructions.

This policy inheritance becomes powerful when combined with Azure Policy's audit and remediation capabilities. Enable the "Allowed virtual machine SKUs" policy in Deny mode at your Production Hub, restricting projects to memory-optimized VM families (D-series, E-series) that match your cost optimization strategy. If your data science team requests GPU-accelerated VMs for model training, they must submit a policy exemption request that your cloud governance team reviews and approves through a formal process. Without this guardrail, teams deploy expensive NC-series VMs that idle overnight, inflating your monthly compute bill by thousands of dollars.

Building on these controls, use Azure Policy to enforce security baselines recommended by Microsoft Defender for Cloud. Apply the "Azure AI services should use private link" policy to ensure all projects connect to Azure OpenAI Service through private endpoints rather than public internet. Configure the "Diagnostic logs should be enabled" policy to automatically create Log Analytics workspace connections for every new project, capturing audit trails that satisfy regulatory requirements. With this approach, your security team defines standards once through policy assignments, and Azure enforces them automatically across hundreds of projects without requiring manual configuration reviews.

  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
    - content: "Which Azure Key Vault access method is recommended for CI/CD pipelines to minimize credential exposure?"
      choices:
        - content: "Storing connection strings in pipeline variables."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Service connections with managed identities provide passwordless authentication eliminating stored credentials and minimizing exposure."
        - content: "Using service connections with managed identities."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Service connections with managed identities provide passwordless authentication to Azure Key Vault eliminating credential storage and reducing security risks."
        - content: "Embedding access keys in pipeline YAML files."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Embedding credentials in code creates security vulnerabilities. Service connections with managed identities eliminate this risk."
        - content: "Sharing Key Vault credentials across multiple pipelines."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Credential sharing violates least privilege principles. Managed identities provide secure per-pipeline authentication."
    - content: "What is the primary difference between Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) and Cloud Workload Protection (CWP) in Microsoft Defender for Cloud?"
      choices:
        - content: "CSPM focuses on real-time threat detection while CWP provides configuration recommendations."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This description reverses the roles. CSPM assesses configuration security posture while CWP provides runtime threat protection."
        - content: "CSPM assesses configuration security posture while CWP provides runtime threat protection."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. CSPM evaluates resource configurations and provides security recommendations, while CWP delivers real-time threat detection and response for running workloads."
        - content: "CSPM monitors on-premises resources while CWP protects cloud resources."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Both CSPM and CWP apply to multicloud and hybrid environments. The distinction is assessment versus protection."
        - content: "CSPM generates compliance reports while CWP performs vulnerability scanning."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Both contribute to compliance and vulnerability management. The primary difference is configuration assessment versus runtime protection."
    - content: "Which Azure Policy effect should be used to automatically remediate non-compliant resources by deploying missing configurations?"
      choices:
        - content: "Deny."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Deny blocks non-compliant deployments but does not deploy missing configurations. DeployIfNotExists provides automatic remediation."
        - content: "Audit."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Audit logs compliance violations without enforcement or remediation. DeployIfNotExists automatically deploys missing configurations."
        - content: "DeployIfNotExists."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. DeployIfNotExists automatically deploys missing configurations such as diagnostic settings, monitoring agents, or encryption when resources do not meet compliance requirements."
        - content: "Modify."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Modify updates existing resource properties. DeployIfNotExists creates new related resources like diagnostic settings or agents."
    - content: "What happens when a ReadOnly resource lock is applied to an Azure storage account?"
      choices:
        - content: "Users can read and update storage account configuration but cannot delete the account."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. ReadOnly locks prevent both updates and deletion. Only read operations are permitted."
        - content: "Users can read data but cannot update configuration or delete the account."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. ReadOnly locks allow read operations while preventing all write operations including configuration updates and resource deletion."
        - content: "Users cannot access the storage account until the lock is removed."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. ReadOnly locks do not prevent read access. Users can read data but cannot modify or delete resources."
        - content: "Users can update data but cannot change storage account access keys."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. ReadOnly locks prevent all write operations including data updates and key regeneration."
    - content: "Which Microsoft Defender for Identity capability helps map identity attacks to the MITRE ATT&CK framework?"
      choices:
        - content: "Automatic alert correlation grouping related suspicious activities into incidents."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. While alert correlation is valuable, security alert categorization with MITRE tactics and techniques provides the ATT&CK framework mapping."
        - content: "Security alert categorization with MITRE tactics and techniques."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Defender for Identity categorizes security alerts using MITRE ATT&CK framework tactics (credential access, lateral movement, domain dominance) and techniques enabling structured threat analysis."
        - content: "Defender portal unified investigation interface."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The unified interface aids investigation but alert categorization with MITRE framework provides the ATT&CK mapping."
        - content: "Domain controller sensor network traffic monitoring."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Sensors collect data but security alert categorization with MITRE framework maps attacks to ATT&CK tactics and techniques."
    - content: "What is the primary benefit of integrating GitHub Advanced Security with Microsoft Defender for Cloud?"
      choices:
        - content: "Automatically fixing all code vulnerabilities detected in repositories."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Integration provides visibility and recommendations but does not automatically fix vulnerabilities. Unified security visibility is the primary benefit."
        - content: "Providing unified security visibility across code repositories and cloud infrastructure."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Integration delivers centralized security dashboard showing code vulnerabilities, infrastructure risks, and runtime threats enabling comprehensive DevSecOps security management."
        - content: "Eliminating need for GitHub Advanced Security licenses for private repositories."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Licensing requirements remain unchanged. Integration provides unified visibility not license changes."
        - content: "Replacing GitHub code scanning with Defender vulnerability scanning."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Integration aggregates findings from both platforms rather than replacing GitHub code scanning capabilities."

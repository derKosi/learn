This module introduced the new revision of **ARM templates** called **Azure Bicep**, which is designed to help developers have an enhanced authoring experience with its integration with **Visual Studio Code** and **Azure CLI**. You learned how it simplifies deployments, encourages reusability, requires less code, and is easy to write and deploy.

## Module accomplishments

In this module, you accomplished the following:

- **Understood what Bicep is:** Learned about **Bicep** as a domain-specific language for **Azure** infrastructure as code.
- **Installed and configured Bicep:** Installed **Bicep CLI** and configured **Visual Studio Code** with the **Bicep** extension for an enhanced authoring experience.
- **Learned Bicep syntax:** Understood **Bicep** file structure including parameters, variables, resources, outputs, and modules.
- **Created Bicep templates:** Wrote **Bicep** files to define **Azure** resources with parameters, variables, and modules.
- **Deployed locally:** Deployed **Bicep** templates using **Azure CLI** and **Cloud Shell**.
- **Deployed with Azure Pipelines:** Integrated **Bicep** deployments into **Azure Pipelines** for continuous deployment.
- **Deployed with GitHub Actions:** Used **GitHub Actions** to automate **Bicep** template deployments.
- **Understood ARM integration:** Learned how **Bicep** transpiles to **Azure Resource Manager** templates.

## Key benefits

**Bicep** provides several key benefits:

- **Simpler syntax:** Easier to read and write compared to **JSON** templates.
- **Type safety:** Validates templates at development time rather than runtime.
- **Automatic dependency management:** Infers resource dependencies automatically.
- **Modularity:** Encourages code reuse through modules.
- **Tooling support:** Excellent integration with **Visual Studio Code** and **Azure CLI**.

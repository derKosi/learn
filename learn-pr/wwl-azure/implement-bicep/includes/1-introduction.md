This module explains what **Bicep** is and how it's integrated into different tools such as **Azure CLI**, **Visual Studio Code**, **Azure Pipelines**, and **GitHub workflows** for infrastructure as code deployment.

## Module overview

**Bicep** is a domain-specific language (DSL) for deploying **Azure** resources declaratively. It provides a simpler syntax than **JSON** templates, automatic dependency management, and type safety. **Bicep** transpiles to **Azure Resource Manager (ARM)** templates, providing all the benefits of infrastructure as code with an improved authoring experience.

This module covers **Bicep** fundamentals, installation, template creation, syntax, and deployment through various automation tools.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- **Understand what Bicep is:** Learn about **Bicep** as a domain-specific language for **Azure** infrastructure as code.
- **Install Bicep:** Install **Bicep CLI** and configure **Visual Studio Code** with the **Bicep extension** for an enhanced authoring experience.
- **Create Bicep templates:** Write **Bicep** files to define **Azure** resources with parameters, variables, and modules.
- **Understand Bicep syntax:** Learn **Bicep** file structure including parameters, variables, resources, outputs, and modules.
- **Deploy resources to Azure:** Use **Azure CLI** and **Cloud Shell** to deploy **Bicep** templates.
- **Deploy with Azure Pipelines:** Integrate **Bicep** deployments into **Azure Pipelines** for continuous deployment.
- **Deploy with GitHub workflows:** Use **GitHub Actions** to automate **Bicep** template deployments.
- **Understand ARM integration:** Learn how **Bicep** transpiles to **Azure Resource Manager** templates.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of infrastructure as code concepts.
- Basic knowledge of **Azure** resources and resource groups.
- Familiarity with **Azure CLI** or **Azure PowerShell**.
- Experience with **Azure Pipelines** or **GitHub workflows** is helpful but not required.

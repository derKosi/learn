Now that you know how to validate, compile, and deploy your resources from your local environment, it's time to extend that and see how to bring that into an **Azure Pipeline** to streamline your deployment process even further.

## Prerequisites

You'll need an **Azure** subscription. If you don't have one, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

You also need an **Azure DevOps** organization. Similarly, if you don't have one, [create one for free](/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/pipelines-sign-up/).

You'll need to have a configured [service connection](/azure/devops/pipelines/library/connect-to-azure/) in your project that is linked to your **Azure** subscription. Don't worry if you haven't done this beforeâ€”we'll show you an easy way to do it when you're creating your pipeline.

You also need to have that **Bicep** file you created earlier pushed into the **Azure Repository** of your project.

## Creating the pipeline

### Create a new pipeline

1. From within your **Azure DevOps** project, select **Pipelines**, and **New pipeline**.
2. Select **Azure Repos Git (YAML)** and specify your **Azure Repo** as a source.

3. Select the **Starter pipeline** from the list of templates.

### Configure the pipeline YAML

4. Replace everything in the starter pipeline file with the following snippet:

    ```yaml
    trigger:
      - main

    name: Deploy Bicep files

    variables:
      vmImageName: "ubuntu-latest"

      azureServiceConnection: "myServiceConnection"
      resourceGroupName: "Bicep"
      location: "eastus"
      templateFile: "main.bicep"
    pool:
      vmImage: $(vmImageName)

    steps:
      - task: AzureCLI@2
        inputs:
          azureSubscription: $(azureServiceConnection)
          scriptType: bash
          scriptLocation: inlineScript
          inlineScript: |
            az --version
            az group create --name $(resourceGroupName) --location $(location)
            az deployment group create --resource-group $(resourceGroupName) --template-file $(templateFile)
    ```

### Understanding the pipeline

This **YAML** pipeline performs the following:

- **Trigger:** Automatically runs when code is pushed to the `main` branch.
- **Variables:** Defines reusable values for the pipeline:
  - `vmImageName`: Specifies the build agent image (**Ubuntu**).
  - `azureServiceConnection`: Name of your **Azure** service connection.
  - `resourceGroupName`: Target resource group for deployment.
  - `location`: **Azure** region for resources.
  - `templateFile`: Path to the **Bicep** file.
- **Pool:** Uses the specified **Ubuntu** virtual machine image.
- **AzureCLI task:** Executes **Azure CLI** commands:

  - `az --version`: Verifies **Azure CLI** version.
  - `az group create`: Creates the resource group.
  - `az deployment group create`: Deploys the **Bicep** template.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Don't forget to replace the `azureServiceConnection` value with your service connection name.

### Save and run

5. Select **Save and run** to create a new commit in your repository containing the pipeline **YAML** file and then run the pipeline. Wait for the pipeline to finish running and check the status.

### Verify deployment

6. Once the pipeline runs successfully, you should be able to see the resource group and the storage account in the **Azure portal**.

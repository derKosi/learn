## Learning objectives

- Configure Azure RBAC role assignments to enforce least-privilege access for AI infrastructure components
- Implement system-assigned managed identities to enable keyless authentication between Azure services
- Deploy and configure Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL as a conversation and metadata store for AI agents
- Evaluate security and governance considerations for production AI workloads on Azure


In this module, you configure the secure infrastructure that Contoso's AI agents require. You assign RBAC roles to grant specific permissions without over-provisioning access, enable managed identities to eliminate connection string management, and deploy Cosmos DB as a scalable conversation store with optimized partition keys and time-to-live policies. By the end of this module, you have hands-on experience building production-ready AI infrastructure that satisfies security auditors and supports global-scale deployments.

This module explores **Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates** and their components, teaching you how to implement **infrastructure as code (IaC)** for Azure deployments. You'll learn about template structure, dependency management, modularization techniques, and secure secrets handling through **Azure Key Vault** integration.

**ARM templates** provide a declarative way to define Azure resources using JSON syntax, enabling consistent and repeatable deployments. You'll also discover **Bicep**, a modern domain-specific language that simplifies ARM template authoring with cleaner syntax while maintaining the same capabilities.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- **Create and deploy Azure resources:** Use ARM templates and Bicep syntax to define infrastructure as code.
- **Understand template components:** Work with parameters, variables, functions, resources, and outputs sections.
- **Manage resource dependencies:** Define deployment order using dependsOn elements and reference functions.
- **Organize and modularize templates:** Create reusable components with linked and nested templates.
- **Secure sensitive data:** Integrate Azure Key Vault to manage secrets, passwords, and certificates securely.
- **Choose deployment modes:** Apply incremental or complete deployment modes based on your scenario.

## Prerequisites

- **DevOps understanding:** Familiarity with continuous deployment and automation concepts.
- **Azure services knowledge:** Basic understanding of Azure resources like virtual machines, storage accounts, and networking.
- **JSON basics:** Ability to read and understand JSON structure and syntax.
- **Version control:** Experience with Git or other version control systems is beneficial.
- **Infrastructure as code concepts:** Understanding of declarative vs. imperative approaches is helpful.ores Azure Resource Manager templates and their components and details dependencies and modularized templates with secrets.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, students and professionals can:

- Create Azure resources using Azure Resource Manager templates.
- Understand Azure Resource Manager templates and template components.
- Manage dependencies and secrets in templates.
- Organize and modularize templates.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of what DevOps is and its concepts.
- Familiarity with version control principles is helpful but isn't necessary.
- Beneficial to have experience in an organization that delivers software.

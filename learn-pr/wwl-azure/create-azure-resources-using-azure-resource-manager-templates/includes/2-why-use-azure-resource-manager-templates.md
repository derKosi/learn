**Resource Manager templates**, also called **Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates**, are JSON files that define the infrastructure and configuration for your Azure deployments. They represent a modern approach to **infrastructure as code (IaC)**, replacing manual and error-prone deployment processes.

## The challenge with manual deployments

Provisioning infrastructure for applications has traditionally been time-consuming and manual. You would:

- **Work through portal wizards:** Click through multiple screens to create each resource individually.
- **Run imperative scripts:** Execute commands in a specific order, repeating for each environment.
- **Maintain outdated documentation:** Struggle to keep configuration documentation synchronized with actual deployments.
- **Face stressful production deployments:** Manual production deployments increase the risk of human error.

**ARM templates solve these problems** by providing a declarative approach where you define what resources you need, and Azure Resource Manager handles the deployment orchestration.

### Reduced errors and increased reliability

- **Eliminate human errors:** Remove the risk of typos, missed steps, or incorrect configurations.
- **Predictable outcomes:** The same template always produces the same infrastructure state.
- **Built-in validation:** Azure validates templates before deployment, catching errors early.

## Complete list of ARM template advantages

Consider using **Resource Manager templates** when you need these benefits:

- **Improved consistency**

**Resource Manager templates provide a common language** for describing deployments. Regardless of the tool (Azure Portal, Azure CLI, PowerShell, or SDKs), the template structure, format, and expressions remain identical. This consistency ensures:

- **Cross-team collaboration:** Developers and operations teams work with the same infrastructure definitions.
- **Multi-environment reliability:** Development, staging, and production use the same template structure.

- **Express complex deployments clearly**

Templates enable you to **deploy multiple resources in the correct order automatically**. For example:

- **Dependency awareness:** Resource Manager won't deploy a virtual machine before creating the OS disk or network interface.
- **Automatic ordering:** Dependency mapping ensures resources are created in the right sequence.
- **Visual representation:** You can see all resources and their relationships in one JSON file.

- **Infrastructure as code paradigm**

Templates are **code that can be shared, tested, and versioned** like any software:

- **Version control:** Store templates in Git repositories to track all infrastructure changes.
- **Code reviews:** Apply standard peer review processes to infrastructure modifications.
- **Testing:** Validate templates using unit tests and automated validation tools.
- **Audit trail:** Every infrastructure change is documented in version history.

- **Promote reuse through parameters**

**Template parameters** enable creating multiple versions of infrastructure from a single template:

```json
"parameters": {
  "environmentName": {
    "type": "string",
    "allowedValues": ["dev", "staging", "production"]
  },
  "vmSize": {
    "type": "string",
    "defaultValue": "Standard_B2s"
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**

- **Environment flexibility:** Use the same template for development (small VMs) and production (large VMs).
- **Cost optimization:** Pass different SKUs or sizes based on environment requirements.
- **Reduced duplication:** Maintain one template instead of separate files per environment.

- **Modular and linkable templates**

You can **link templates together** to create modular, reusable components:

- **Small, focused templates:** Create templates for specific resources (networking, storage, compute).
- **Composition:** Combine small templates into complete solutions.
- **Reusability:** Share common components across multiple projects.
- **Maintainability:** Update one module and all dependent deployments benefit.

- **Simplified orchestration**

Deploy all resources with a **single command**:

```bash
az deployment group create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --template-file main.json \
  --parameters @parameters.json
```

**What happens:**

- Resource Manager analyzes all resources and dependencies.
- Creates resources in parallel where possible.
- Handles any deployment errors and provides detailed logs.
- Returns when all resources are deployed successfully.

## Azure Quickstart Templates

**Azure Quickstart Templates** provide a community-driven library of ready-to-use templates for common deployment scenarios. This open-source repository offers:

- **Hundreds of templates:** Pre-built solutions for web apps, databases, virtual machines, networking, and more.
- **Best practices:** Templates follow Azure recommendations and security guidelines.
- **Learning resource:** Study how experienced developers structure their infrastructure code.
- **Customization starting point:** Download templates and adapt them to your specific requirements.

**Example use cases:**

- Deploy a WordPress site with Azure App Service and MySQL.
- Create a Kubernetes cluster with AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service).
- Set up a data analytics pipeline with Azure Data Factory.

**Access the library:** [Azure Quickstart Templates on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates)

## Bicep: Modern ARM template alternative

While this module focuses on **JSON ARM templates**, it's important to know about **Bicep**, a domain-specific language for defining Azure infrastructure:

- **Cleaner syntax:** Bicep provides simpler, more readable syntax compared to JSON.
- **Same capabilities:** Bicep compiles to ARM templates, so you get all ARM features.
- **Better tooling:** Enhanced IDE support with IntelliSense and validation.
- **Native Azure support:** Fully supported by Microsoft as the recommended IaC language.

**Example comparison:**

```bicep
// Bicep syntax (cleaner)
resource storageAccount 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2021-02-01' = {
  name: 'mystorageaccount'
  location: 'eastus'
  sku: {
    name: 'Standard_LRS'
  }
  kind: 'StorageV2'
}
```

```json
// Equivalent JSON ARM template
{
  "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
  "apiVersion": "2021-02-01",
  "name": "mystorageaccount",
  "location": "eastus",
  "sku": {
    "name": "Standard_LRS"
  },
  "kind": "StorageV2"
}
```

**When to use Bicep:** For new projects, consider Bicep as your primary IaC language. For existing ARM templates, you can convert them to Bicep using the `az bicep decompile` command.

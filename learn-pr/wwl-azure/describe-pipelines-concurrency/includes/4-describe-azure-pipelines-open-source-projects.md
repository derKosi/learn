Azure DevOps provides powerful DevOps capabilities including source control, planning, builds, releases, and testing. While these features typically require user authentication, public projects enable broader community collaboration.

## Public vs private projects

**Public projects** allow anonymous users to:

- View source code, commits, branches, and pull requests
- Browse work items and project dashboards
- Access project wikis
- Search code and work items (read-only access)

**Private projects** require:

- User authentication and project access permissions
- Signed-in users to access any services

## Open-source benefits

Public projects are ideal for open-source development. Consider this scenario:

**Before public projects**: A popular open-source library has build badges in their README, but clicking them shows "access denied" unless you're a project maintainer.

**With public projects**: Anyone can view build results, understand failures, and contribute fixes through pull requests.

This transparency helps community members:

- Debug build issues
- Contribute improvements
- Understand project health
- Learn from CI/CD practices

## Free tier eligibility for public projects

You automatically qualify for free Azure Pipelines parallel jobs for public projects when:

- Your pipeline runs in an Azure DevOps public project
- Your pipeline builds a public repository (GitHub or Azure DevOps)

**Free tier includes**:

- **Public projects**: 10 parallel jobs for Microsoft-hosted agents (unlimited minutes)
- **Private projects**: 1 parallel job (60 minutes max, 1,800 minutes/month)

## Common questions

**User limits**: Azure Pipelines has no per-user charges. Unlimited users can create builds and releases with basic or stakeholder access.

**Pipeline limits**: Create unlimited build and release pipelines at no cost. Register unlimited self-hosted agents for free.

**Visual Studio Enterprise**: Subscribers get one additional self-hosted parallel job per organization.

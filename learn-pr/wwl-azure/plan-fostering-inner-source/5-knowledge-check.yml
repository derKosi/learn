  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
    - content: "What is a fork?"
      choices:
        - content: "A fork is a copy of a code repository."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Yes! A fork creates your own copy of someone else's repository."
        - content: "A fork is a branch for future work."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "No. A fork is a copy of a repository, not a branch."
        - content: "A fork is a way to work with centralized version control."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "No. A fork is a copy of a repository that you can change."
    - content: "What are the correct steps for the fork workflow in the proper sequence?"
      choices:
        - content: "Create a fork. Make changes locally. Push to a branch. Create a pull request."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This is missing some important steps. You need to clone the fork locally and sync it with the original repository."
        - content: "Create a fork. Clone it locally. Make changes. Push to a branch. Create a pull request. Sync your fork."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Yes! This is the complete fork workflow that keeps your copy updated."
        - content: "Create a fork. Clone it locally. Make changes. Create a pull request. Push changes."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The steps are in the wrong order. You must push changes before creating a pull request."
    - content: "When should you use a single repository instead of forks?"
      choices:
        - content: "For large teams with many developers."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Large teams usually benefit from using forks to manage contributions better."
        - content: "For teams with 10-20 developers."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Teams this size often work better with forks to avoid conflicts."
        - content: "For small teams with 2-5 developers."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Yes! Small teams can work directly in one repository without needing forks."

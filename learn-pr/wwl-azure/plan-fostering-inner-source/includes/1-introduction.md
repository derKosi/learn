This module shows you how to use Git to foster inner source development in your organization and implement fork workflows for better collaboration.

## What is inner source?

Inner source is a development approach where teams within an organization collaborate on code projects using open source principles and practices. Instead of working in isolated silos, teams can share code, contribute to each other's projects, and build on existing work across the organization.

## Why inner source matters

- **Breaking Down Silos**: Inner source helps break down barriers between teams and departments, enabling better knowledge sharing and collaboration.
- **Code Reuse**: Teams can discover and reuse existing code instead of building everything from scratch, which saves time and reduces duplication.
- **Better Quality**: When multiple teams can review and contribute to code, it often leads to higher quality software with fewer bugs.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Developers learn from each other's work and can apply best practices across different projects.

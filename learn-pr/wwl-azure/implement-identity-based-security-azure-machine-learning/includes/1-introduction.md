Modern AI development requires balancing two competing priorities: enabling data scientists to iterate quickly while maintaining strict security controls. Traditional approaches force teams to choose between productivity and protection. Microsoft Entra ID integration with Azure Machine Learning eliminates this trade-off by providing identity-based security controls that adapt to your team's workflow. With properly configured security groups, Conditional Access policies, and enterprise application integrations, you can prove to auditors that only authorized users access AI resources—without slowing down model development.

This module guides you through implementing identity-based security for Azure Machine Learning workspaces using Microsoft Entra ID. You configure security groups that organize AI team members by role, create Conditional Access policies that enforce multifactor authentication and device compliance, integrate service principals for automated pipelines, and monitor access patterns through audit logs. By the end, you have the skills to secure AI infrastructure while maintaining the agility your data science teams need.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you're able to:

- Configure Microsoft Entra security groups to organize AI team members and enforce least-privilege access

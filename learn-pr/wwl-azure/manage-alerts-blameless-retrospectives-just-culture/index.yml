title: Manage alerts, blameless retrospectives and a just culture
summary: This module teaches you to manage monitoring alerts effectively, conduct blameless retrospectives that focus on learning rather than blame, and build a just culture where engineers feel safe reporting mistakes. Learn to improve application performance by identifying real issues with Azure Application Insights smart detection, reducing meaningless alerts, and understanding server response-time degradation patterns.
abstract: |
  By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

  - Configure Azure Application Insights smart detection and interpret performance degradation notifications.
  - Diagnose and improve application performance using telemetry and profiler data.
  - Reduce alert fatigue by distinguishing actionable alerts from meaningless noise.
  - Conduct blameless retrospectives that focus on system improvements rather than individual blame.
  - Build a just culture where engineers learn from mistakes without fear of punishment.

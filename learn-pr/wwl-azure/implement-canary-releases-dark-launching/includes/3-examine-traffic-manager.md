Azure Web App deployment slot functionality enables rapid version switching through seamless swap operations, providing foundational blue-green deployment capabilities.

Advanced traffic distribution requirements demand granular control beyond basic slot swapping, necessitating sophisticated traffic management solutions for progressive rollout strategies.

Azure Traffic Manager delivers enterprise-grade traffic orchestration capabilities enabling fine-grained distribution control across deployment targets.

## Azure Traffic Manager

Azure Traffic Manager implements DNS-based traffic load balancing delivering optimal service distribution across global Azure regions through intelligent routing algorithms that maximize availability and minimize latency.

DNS-layer traffic direction enables client request routing to optimal service endpoints based on configurable traffic-routing methodologies and continuous endpoint health validation.

Endpoint definitions encompass internet-accessible services hosted within Azure infrastructure or external platforms, providing deployment flexibility and hybrid architecture support.

Comprehensive traffic-routing methodology portfolio and endpoint monitoring frameworks support diverse application requirements including automatic failover orchestration and disaster recovery scenarios.

Regional failure resilience ensures continued operation during catastrophic events including complete Azure region outages through intelligent endpoint failover and geographic redundancy.

Traffic Manager provides six traffic distribution methodologies supporting diverse architectural requirements and operational patterns:\*\*

- **Priority routing:** Primary endpoint traffic concentration with automatic failover to backup endpoints during unavailability events.
- **Weighted distribution:** Configurable proportional traffic allocation across endpoint sets enabling gradual rollout and A/B testing scenarios.
- **Performance-based routing:** Geographic proximity optimization directing users to lowest-latency endpoints for optimal response times.
- **Geographic routing:** DNS query origin-based endpoint selection supporting data sovereignty compliance, content localization, and regional traffic analytics.
- **MultiValue responses:** IPv4/IPv6 endpoint aggregation returning all healthy endpoints for client-side selection strategies.
- **Subnet-based routing:** Source IP address range mapping to specific endpoints enabling network topology-aware traffic distribution.

Weighted distribution methodology predominates in Continuous Delivery implementations, enabling percentage-based traffic allocation essential for canary releases and progressive rollout strategies.

> [!NOTE]
> Traffic routing exclusively targets available endpoints, automatically excluding unhealthy or unreachable services from distribution algorithms.

## Controlling Your Canary Release

Integrated feature toggle, deployment slot, and Traffic Manager orchestration delivers comprehensive traffic flow control enabling sophisticated canary release implementations.

Deployment workflow sequences:\*\*

1. **Feature deployment:** New functionality deployment to isolated deployment slots or dedicated application instances.
2. **Validation gate:** Deployment verification confirming successful artifact installation before activation.
3. **Traffic allocation:** Percentage-based traffic distribution configuration targeting minimal user cohort exposure.
4. **Behavioral monitoring:** Application Insights integration enabling comprehensive performance and stability telemetry collection.

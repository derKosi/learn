Build and release platforms execute repeatable actions during the build process. Tasks are executable code units that perform specific actions in defined sequences.

Pipeline steps define build specifications, test execution, and process completion requirements.

Available task categories include building, testing, utility execution, packaging, and deployment.

Community-contributed tasks are available through platform marketplaces when standard tasks don't meet requirements.

Jenkins, Azure DevOps, and Atlassian maintain extensive marketplaces with additional task options.

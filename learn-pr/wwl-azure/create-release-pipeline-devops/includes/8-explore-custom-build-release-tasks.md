Custom build and release tasks provide alternatives to standard tasks, command-line operations, and shell scripts.

Custom tasks can be shared publicly or privately with specific teams and organizations.

Custom task development offers several advantages:

- Access to restricted variables not available in standard tasks
- Reusable secure endpoint connections to target servers
- Safe and efficient organization-wide distribution
- Encapsulated implementation details for enhanced security

As software projects get bigger and more complex, normal Git workflows can run into problems that slow down teams. You can solve these challenges with a good repository management strategy that includes tools like Scalar and cross-repo sharing.

## Scalar

Scalar is a Git virtual file system extension created by Microsoft. It makes large repositories work faster by speeding up cloning and checkout operations. It does this using caching and background maintenance.

When you use Scalar to clone a Git repository, it saves the repository's metadata locally on your computer. This metadata includes information about branches, tags, and commit history. By saving this data, Scalar makes cloning much faster. Later Git operations can use this saved data, making them faster too.

Scalar also uses background maintenance to keep the saved metadata current. This means Scalar regularly checks for changes to the repository and updates the saved metadata. By doing this, Scalar makes sure the saved data is always accurate and current, which helps performance even more.

## Cross-repository sharing

Cross-repository sharing means sharing code, dependencies, and resources across multiple Git repositories in your organization. This helps teams reuse code, collaborate better, and maintain their projects by using shared components and libraries across different projects.

## Scaling and optimizing Git repositories

When creating an organizational strategy for scaling and optimizing Git repositories, you should consider several important things.

### Implementing Scalar for large repositories

Look at the size and complexity of each repository in your organization. Find the larger ones that contain lots of historical data. Consider using Scalar to improve their performance and reduce resource usage. Follow Microsoft's guidance on setting up Scalar to prefetch and cache data in a way that works best.

### Optimizing repository structure

Look at how your Git repositories are currently organized. Consider breaking down large single repositories into smaller, easier-to-manage ones that each focus on a specific component or module. Use a modular approach to organize repositories. Use Git submodules or Git sub repositories to manage dependencies between repositories while helping teams reuse and share code across projects.

Git submodules let you include one Git repository as a folder within another Git repository. This is useful when you want to include external code or libraries in your project. When you add a Git submodule, Git creates a text file called ".gitmodules" that contains information about the submodule, including its URL and the commit it's currently pointing to.

Git sub repositories are a newer way to include one Git repository as a folder within another Git repository. Unlike submodules, sub repositories are managed by a separate tool called "git-subrepo" and don't need a separate ".gitmodules" file. Also, sub repositories can be split off into their own standalone repositories anytime, while submodules always stay as part of the main repository.

### Promoting cross-repository sharing

Create clear guidelines and best practices for sharing code and resources across repositories in your organization. Encourage teams to use Git submodules or Git sub repositories to reference shared components or libraries hosted in separate repositories.

As part of your plan, consider using a centralized package registry or artifact repository to publish and use shared dependencies consistently across projects. Make sure to clearly communicate your strategy throughout the organization. Encourage collaboration between teams to find opportunities for code sharing and reuse, and implement it based on your guidance.

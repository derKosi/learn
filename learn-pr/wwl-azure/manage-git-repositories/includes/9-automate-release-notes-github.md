After learning how to create and manage release tags in your repository, you'll learn how to set up automatically generated release notes for your GitHub releases.

You can create an overview of what's included in a release, and you can also customize your automated release notes.

You can use labels to create custom categories to organize pull requests. You can also choose to include or exclude specific labels and users from the output.

## Creating automatically generated release notes

When setting up your release, you'll see the option "Auto-generate release notes" to include all changes between your tag and the last release. If you never created a release before, it includes all changes from your repository.

You can choose to customize it or leave it as it is.

## Setting up automatically generated release notes template

You can customize the auto-generate release notes template by following these steps:

1.  Go to your repository and create a new file.

2.  Use the name **.github/release.yml** to create the **release.yml** file in the **.github** directory.

3.  Write in YAML format which pull request labels and authors you want to exclude from this release. You can also create new categories and list the pull request labels in each. For more information about setup options, see [Automatically generated release notes - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/automatically-generated-release-notes#configuration-options).

    **Example setup:**

    ```YML
    # .github/release.yml

    changelog:
      exclude:
        labels:
        - ignore-for-release
        authors:
        - octocat
      categories:
        - title: Breaking Changes ðŸ› 
          labels:
            - Semver-Major
            - breaking-change
        - title: Exciting New Features ðŸŽ‰
          labels:
            - Semver-Minor
            - enhancement
        - title: Other Changes
          labels:
            - *
    ```

4.  Commit your new file.

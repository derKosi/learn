Feature Flags enable runtime system behavior modification through configuration-driven conditional logic without requiring code deployment, supporting targeted feature exposure to specific user cohorts.

Feature Flag architectures resolve trunk-based development challenges by enabling continuous integration of incomplete functionality that remains dormant until activation through configuration changes.

Implementation patterns leverage conditional logic variables that control feature execution paths at runtime.

Consider a collaborative banking application development scenario where all team members commit directly to the main trunk branch to eliminate complex merge operations.

Critical interest calculation modifications require extended development periods while maintaining daily operational stability for production users dependent on existing calculation logic.

Multi-week development cycles cannot compromise trunk stability or block other development activities during feature completion.

Feature Flag implementation provides isolation mechanisms enabling parallel development workflows.

Feature Flag configuration enables selective code path execution where users without flag activation continue utilizing original interest calculation logic while development team members with flag enablement access new calculation implementations.

This pattern exemplifies **Business Feature Flags:** conditional logic controlling business functionality and application behavior.

**Release Flags** constitute the alternative Feature Flag category. Following interest calculation development completion, risk mitigation strategies may require gradual rollout rather than immediate universal deployment.

Canary user cohorts comprise early adopters demonstrating higher tolerance for new functionality and potential issues, named after historical canary usage in coal mine safety monitoring.

Configuration updates enable Canary user flag activation for new code validation. Issue detection triggers immediate flag deactivation for rapid rollback without deployment operations.

**A/B Testing** Release Flags enable controlled experimentation for feature performance evaluation and user task completion efficiency measurement.

User cohort segmentation allocates 50% to original implementation and 50% to new functionality, enabling direct outcome comparison for data-driven feature retention decisions. Feature Flag and Feature Toggle terminology represent identical concepts.

Runtime feature exposure through configuration switching enables deployment without immediate user-facing functionality changes, decoupling deployment from feature activation.

Feature release strategy selection requires careful consideration:

- **Targeted segment exposure:** Controlled rollout to specific user cohorts for feedback collection and usage pattern analysis.
- **Percentage-based randomization:** Statistical user distribution for unbiased performance evaluation.
- **Universal simultaneous activation:** Complete user base feature enablement for consistent experience delivery.

Business stakeholder collaboration proves essential for strategy selection, requiring close partnership to align technical implementation with business objectives and risk tolerance.

System behavior monitoring constitutes critical operational practice across all deployment patterns, requiring continuous observation and analysis.

Feature deployment and exposure separation provides compelling Continuous Delivery integration benefits supporting enhanced release stability and simplified rollback procedures.

Problematic feature detection enables immediate deactivation without deployment rollback, followed by hotfix development addressing root causes. Deployment-exposure decoupling enables anytime release capabilities since new code remains dormant without impacting production system stability.

## What are feature toggles?

Feature toggle terminology encompasses multiple synonymous designations including feature flippers, feature flags, feature switches, and conditional features representing identical runtime control mechanisms.

Beyond business functionality benefits, feature toggles provide significant development workflow advantages through improved isolation and integration patterns.

Feature toggles serve as viable branching alternatives within version control workflows. Traditional branch-based feature isolation maintains separate codelines requiring eventual merge operations with release branches before production deployment.

Toggle-based development implements features behind runtime switches enabling trunk-based development. Disabled features during release cycles remain unexposed and operationally isolated from production functionality despite code presence.

## How to implement a feature toggle

Fundamental feature toggle implementation utilizes conditional IF statement logic for binary execution path selection.

Toggle deactivation executes the IF block code path, while activation triggers ELSE block execution.

Advanced implementations support sophisticated control mechanisms including centralized dashboard management, role-based access controls, user-specific targeting, and granular segmentation capabilities.

Commercial and open-source feature toggle frameworks provide comprehensive implementation options supporting diverse organizational requirements and complexity levels.

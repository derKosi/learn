Effective knowledge sharing is fundamental to successful software development teams. As teams build products, solve problems, and refine processes, they accumulate valuable organizational knowledge. Without systematic approaches to capture and share this knowledge, teams repeatedly face the same challenges, waste time rediscovering solutions, and struggle when team members leave.

This module teaches you to implement practical knowledge sharing strategies using Azure DevOps Wikis, GitHub documentation, and Microsoft Teams integration. You'll learn to create accessible documentation, preserve organizational learning, and establish collaboration patterns that keep your team informed and productive.

**Why knowledge sharing matters**

**Preserve organizational learning:** Teams accumulate wisdom through experience—documenting prevents knowledge loss when people change roles or leave.

**Reduce repeated mistakes:** Captured lessons from past incidents, bugs, and architecture decisions help teams avoid repeating failures.

**Accelerate onboarding:** New team members get productive faster when documentation clearly explains systems, standards, and practices.

**Support decision-making:** Documented architecture decisions, design rationales, and trade-off analyses help teams make consistent choices.

**Enable asynchronous collaboration:** Written documentation allows team members across time zones and schedules to stay informed without constant meetings.

**Common knowledge sharing challenges**

**Knowledge lives in people's heads:** Critical information remains undocumented, accessible only through verbal questions.

**Documentation becomes outdated:** Teams create initial documentation but fail to maintain it as systems evolve.

**Information scattered across tools:** Knowledge fragments across emails, chat messages, wikis, tickets, and code comments—difficult to find when needed.

**No clear ownership:** Without accountability, documentation gaps persist and quality degrades over time.

This module addresses these challenges by teaching you to use integrated tools that make documentation creation, maintenance, and discovery straightforward.

## What you'll learn

**Knowledge sharing strategies:**

- Identify what knowledge to document and when
- Establish documentation ownership and maintenance practices
- Create living documentation that teams actually use
- Balance documentation completeness against maintenance effort

**Azure DevOps Wikis:**

- Create project wikis and provision repositories
- Configure permissions for Contributors, readers, and administrators
- Publish existing Git repositories as wikis
- Organize wiki structure with pages, sub-pages, and navigation

**Markdown and documentation formatting:**

- Write technical documentation using Markdown syntax
- Use GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) extensions
- Include code blocks, tables, lists, and links
- Attach files and embed videos in wiki pages

**Mermaid diagrams:**

- Create flowcharts to document processes and workflows
- Build sequence diagrams for system interactions
- Generate graphs to visualize dependencies
- Integrate diagrams directly in Markdown documentation

**Microsoft Teams integration:**

- Connect GitHub to Teams for pull request and issue notifications
- Integrate Azure DevOps Boards for work item updates in Teams
- Configure Azure Repos notifications for code review discussions
- Set up Azure Pipelines alerts for build and deployment events
- Use subscriptions and filters to control notification noise
- Enable compose extensions for searching and sharing information

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

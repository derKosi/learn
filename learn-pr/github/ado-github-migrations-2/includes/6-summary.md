You now have two essential capabilities: seeing your source environment clearly and preparing a target environment teams will want to use. If you do these well, the actual migration becomes execution rather than discovery. Share your Phase 2 findings with stakeholders to align expectations, and use your Phase 3 setup to onboard a pilot team quickly. Momentum mattersâ€”create it with clarity and good defaults.

In this module, you learned how to:

- **Assess your Azure DevOps environment comprehensively** - You can now generate detailed inventories and interpret the data to understand migration complexity and requirements.

- **Analyze repository characteristics** - You understand how to identify factors that affect migration approach, timeline, and resource requirements.

- **Map service dependencies** - You can evaluate Azure Boards and Azure Pipelines usage to choose appropriate migration strategies.

- **Validate GitHub Enterprise Cloud setup** - You know how to verify authentication, security posture, and environment type configurations.

- **Design effective organization structures** - You can create team and repository structures that match how your enterprise actually collaborates.

- **Implement governance foundations** - You've established repository standards, rulesets, and ownership patterns that support productive development workflows.

- **Configure hybrid integrations** - You can maintain Azure DevOps service connections during transition periods to reduce migration risk.

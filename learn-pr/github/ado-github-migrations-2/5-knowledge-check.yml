  questions:
  - content: "Which command generates comprehensive Azure DevOps inventory CSV files for migration planning?"
    choices:
    - content: "`gh ado2gh migrate-repo`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This command is used for actual repository migration, not inventory generation."
    - content: "`gh ado2gh inventory-report`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! This command generates detailed CSV files containing organizations, team projects, repositories, and pipelines information."
    - content: "`gh ado2gh generate-script`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This command generates migration scripts, not inventory reports."
    - content: "`gh ado2gh integrate-boards`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This command configures Azure Boards integration, not inventory assessment."
  - content: "Which GitHub Enterprise Cloud environment types require SCIM provisioning for identity management?"
    choices:
    - content: "GitHub Enterprise Cloud Standard only"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Standard environments use SSO overlay but don't require SCIM provisioning."
    - content: "Enterprise Managed Users (EMU) and Data Residency environments"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Both EMU and Data Residency environments require SCIM provisioning for centralized identity management."
    - content: "Any organization with SAML SSO enabled"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning are separate capabilities with different requirements."
    - content: "Only Data Residency environments"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Both EMU and Data Residency environments require SCIM, not just Data Residency."
  - content: "What is the recommended default repository visibility setting for newly migrated repositories?"
    choices:
    - content: "Public"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Public visibility exposes repositories outside the organization, which is usually not desired for enterprise migrations."
    - content: "Internal"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While Internal visibility is good for shared libraries, Private is safer as the default for migrated repositories."
    - content: "Private"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Private visibility is the safest default, allowing you to selectively open access as needed rather than accidentally exposing sensitive code."
    - content: "Fork-only"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Fork-only is not a standard repository visibility setting in GitHub."
  - content: "What does the Azure Boards 'integrate-boards' command provide that 'configure-autolink' does not?"
    choices:
    - content: "GitHub repository autolinks to Azure DevOps work items"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Both commands can create autolinks, but integrate-boards provides additional capabilities."
    - content: "Azure DevOps service connection and bidirectional work item linking"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The integrate-boards command creates service connections and enables full bidirectional linking and synchronization between GitHub and Azure Boards."
    - content: "Release notes migration from Azure DevOps"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Neither command handles release notes migration."
    - content: "Wiki content synchronization"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. These commands focus on work item linking, not wiki content."

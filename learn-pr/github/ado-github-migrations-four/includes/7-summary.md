Phase 6 cements the migration: identities reconciled, governance enforced, integrations verified, developers enabled, and ADO properly retired. You've also put in place a lightweight operating model with health checks and metrics that keep the platform safe and helpful. From here, iterate with teams: measure, share wins, and evolve policies as collaboration patterns emerge.

### What you accomplished

In this module, you learned how to:

- **Resolve mannequin identities** to preserve contributor history and PR ownership
- **Apply organization-wide governance** and security baselines with confidence
- **Validate Azure Boards and Pipelines integrations** to maintain traceability and flow
- **Enable developers at scale** with checklists, scripts, and clear communications
- **Retire Azure DevOps responsibly** with audit-ready exports
- **Run the platform** with simple, repeatable health checks and KPIs

### Key takeaways

- **Start with secure defaults**: Apply governance consistently, then relax policies thoughtfully where needed
- **Make adoption frictionless**: Provide clear checklists, scripts, and communications to help teams succeed immediately
- **Preserve audit trails**: Export and archive ADO data properly before decommissioning
- **Measure what matters**: Track adoption, flow, security, and reliability metrics to demonstrate value and identify improvement areas
- **Plan for operations**: Establish clear ownership and escalation paths for ongoing platform management

### Next steps

- Set up monthly governance and health check reviews
- Establish feedback loops with development teams
- Plan for feature evolution based on team needs
- Consider advanced GitHub Enterprise features as adoption grows

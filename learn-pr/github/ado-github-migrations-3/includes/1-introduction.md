You've reached the critical testing and production migration phases of your Azure DevOps to GitHub Enterprise migration journey. In Phase 4, you'll validate your migration plan with real repositories, proving data integrity, identity mapping, workflow conversion, and integrations work as expected. In Phase 5, you'll execute the production migration at scale while maintaining clear stakeholder communication and business continuity.

This module provides practical runbooks and guidance to help you understand not just what to do, but why each step reduces risk and builds confidence before, during, and after go-live.

## Scenario

You're the migration lead for a software development organization transitioning from Azure DevOps to GitHub Enterprise.

You need to ensure data integrity, maintain business continuity, and keep all stakeholders informed throughout the process.

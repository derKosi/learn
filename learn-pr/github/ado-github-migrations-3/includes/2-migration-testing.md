In testing, prove assumptions with evidence. Pick repositories that reflect your variety: a quick win, a representative "middle," and a heavyweight with history or binaries. Your goal isn't perfection—it's confidence and clarity about risks.

## Design the test plan

Treat tests as stakeholder rehearsal. You're validating not just code history but how people will work the day after migration.

### Execute test migrations

**Step 1. Create the test organization**

Create test organization for migration validation:

gh api -X POST /organizations \
  -f login="test-migration-org" \
  -f admin="your-username"

**Step 2: Select test repositories**

Choose tiers:

- Small (PoC): <100MB, simple branches, minimal integrations
- Medium (Representative): 100MB–1GB, multiple branches/tags, some integrations
- Large (Performance): >1GB, extensive history, complex branching or LFS needs

Define success criteria:

- Data integrity: history, branches, tags, files match
- Identity/auth: SSO works; team permissions map correctly
- Governance: default branch, protections/rulesets active
- Integrations: Boards linking and pipelines (if hybrid) function as expected
- Timing: within acceptable windows

> [!TIP]
> Document expected vs. observed outcomes for each tier; these become your production estimates.

**Step 3: Run test migration script**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# test-migration.sh (example)

# Variables
ADO_ORG="source-ado-org"
ADO_TEAM_PROJECT="test-project"
ADO_REPO="test-repository"
GITHUB_ORG="test-migration-org"
GITHUB_REPO="migrated-test-repository"

# Execute test migration
gh ado2gh migrate-repo \
--ado-org "$ADO_ORG" \
--ado-team-project "$ADO_TEAM_PROJECT" \
--ado-repo "$ADO_REPO" \
--github-org "$GITHUB_ORG" \
--github-repo "$GITHUB_REPO" \
--wait

# Validate at a glance
gh repo view "$GITHUB_ORG/$GITHUB_REPO" --json createdAt,diskUsage,defaultBranchRef
```

What to watch:

- Long pauses may signal network throttling or repo size bottlenecks. Note timestamped milestones.

## Validate results

Use a structured checklist. Avoid "it looks okay" - require explicit evidence.

**Data integrity:**

- Files and structure preserved; sample diff checks pass
- Full commit history with correct authors and timestamps
- Branch and tag counts match expectations
- Releases present where expected (if in scope)

**Identity and access:**

- SSO login works for pilot users
- Teams and permissions reflect your Phase 3 design
- Unable to push to protected branches without PR (negative test)

**Governance and security:**

- Default branch is `main`
- Required reviews and status checks enforced on protected branches
- Secret scanning and dependency features enabled for private repos (if adopted)

**Integrations (optional/hybrid):**

- Azure Boards autolinks render (`AB#123`) and link correctly
- If full Boards integration: webhook active; test commit updates work item
- Azure Pipelines triggers from GitHub.com; builds succeed or expected errors are known with remediation

Useful scripts from your toolkit:

```bash
# Developer workflow smoke test
git clone https://github.com/org/repo.git
cd repo && git checkout -b feature/test-branch
echo "test change" >> README.md
git add README.md && git commit -m "Test commit"
git push origin feature/test-branch
gh pr create --title "Test PR" --body "Testing workflow"
```

## UAT and sign-off

Approach:

1. Invite a small pilot team to validate daily workflows for 24–48 hours
1. Collect feedback on developer ergonomics (PRs, reviews, required checks)
1. Confirm integration behaviors in real usage
1. Record gaps and remediation steps; adjust production plan (Phase 5)

"Definition of Ready" for Phase 5:

1. Test objectives met or conscious exceptions documented with mitigation
1. Stakeholders agree on production order and freeze windows
1. Rollback plan rehearsed on a test repo

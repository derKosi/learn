# Microsoft Learn Writing Style Guide

Apply these style guidelines when creating or editing Microsoft Learn content.

## Voice and Tone

- Use **second person ("you")** to speak directly to readers
- Remove unnecessary uses of first-person plural ("we") unless required for privacy/security contexts
- Maintain a **friendly, conversational tone** while remaining professional
- Use **common contractions** (it's, don't, you're) to sound more natural

## Word Choice and Clarity

- Replace **complex words with simple alternatives** (use "use" instead of "utilize," "remove" instead of "extract")
- **Eliminate jargon** unless the technical audience requires it, and define technical terms on first use
- Remove **unnecessary adverbs** (very, quickly, easily) and wordy phrases
- Use **precise, one-word verbs** in active voice
- Ensure **US spelling** throughout (license, not licence)
- Avoid Latin abbreviations (use "for example" instead of "e.g.," "that is" instead of "i.e.")
- Don't create new meanings for common words or use nouns as verbs

## Grammar and Structure

- Use **present tense** verbs (the action is happening now)
- Prefer **active voice** over passive voice
- Write in **indicative mood** (statements of fact) for most content
- Use **imperative mood** (direct commands) only for procedures
- Ensure subject-verb agreement
- Keep sentences **short and simple** (aim for 3-7 lines per paragraph)
- Avoid **dangling or misplaced modifiers**
- Limit **chains of prepositional phrases** to two maximum

## Capitalization

- Apply **sentence-style capitalization** for most text (capitalize only the first word and proper nouns)
- Use **title-style capitalization** only for product/service names, book titles, and formal titles
- Don't use all-caps for emphasis (use italic sparingly instead)
- Lowercase the spelled-out form of acronyms unless they're proper nouns

## Punctuation

- End all sentences with **periods** (even two-word sentences)
- Use **one space** after periods, not two
- Include the **Oxford comma** in series
- Use **colons** to introduce lists
- Avoid semicolons (rewrite as multiple sentences or lists)
- Place quotation marks **outside commas and periods** (except when part of quoted material)
- **Don't use slashes** to indicate choices (use "or" instead)

## Numbers and Formatting

- **Spell out** zero through nine; use numerals for 10 and above
- Use numerals for **measurements, percentages, time, and technical values**
- Add **commas** to numbers with four or more digits (1,000)
- Spell out month names; don't use ordinal numbers for dates
- Use **en dashes** (not hyphens) for number ranges, but prefer "from X through Y"
- Highlight the most important concepts in **bold**; use *italics* sparingly for emphasis

## Acronyms and Abbreviations

- **Spell out** acronyms on first use with the acronym in parentheses
- Don't spell out if the acronym is in Merriam-Webster or widely known to the audience
- Use **"a" or "an"** based on pronunciation (an ISP, a SQL database)

## Lists and Structure

- Use **numbered lists** for sequential steps or prioritized items
- Use **bulleted lists** for items that don't need a specific order
- Limit lists to **2-7 items**
- Keep list items **parallel in structure**
- **Capitalize** the first word of each list item
- Use **periods** only if items are complete sentences

## Procedures and Instructions

- Write procedures with **no more than seven numbered steps**
- Use **imperative verbs** (Select, Enter, Clear)
- Use **input-neutral verbs** (select, not click; open, not launch)
- Provide context for where actions occur ("On the Design tab...")
- Format UI element names in **bold** when referenced in instructions

## Scannable Content

- Add **descriptive headings** every 3-5 paragraphs
- Use **sentence-style capitalization** in headings
- Keep headings **short** (ideally one line)
- Front-load **keywords** in headings and opening sentences
- Break long content into sections with clear navigation

## Accessibility and Inclusivity

- Use **gender-neutral pronouns** (avoid "he" or "she" in generic references)
- Support **"they" as a singular pronoun** for non-binary individuals
- Avoid terms that exclude or stereotype
- Don't use idioms, humor, or cultural references that won't translate globally

## Tables and Visual Elements

- Use tables only when data has **two or more attributes** to compare
- Include a **header row** with specific column labels
- Use **sentence-style capitalization** in table headers and cells
- Keep cell content **brief** (ideally one line)
- Make entries **parallel** within columns

## Content Quality Checks

- **Remove duplication** - Scan for repeated explanations, examples, or procedures across units
- **Eliminate redundancy** - Each unit should have unique content; avoid copying testing, deployment, or configuration details between units
- **Check knowledge checks** - Ensure 3-5 questions maximum; remove redundant or overly similar questions
- **Verify media references** - Confirm all images exist in the media/ folder; copy from reference modules if needed
